This new blog will deal with chemblaics in the broader sense, and will not be restricted to research in this field
in which I am involved personally.

Chemblaics (pronounced chem-bla-ics) is the science that uses computers to address and possibly solve problems in
the area of chemistry, biochemistry and related fields. The general denomiter seems to be molecules, but I might
be wrong there.

The **big** difference between chemblaics and areas as cheminformatics, chemoinformatics, chemometrics, proteochemometrics,
etc, is that chemblaic *only* uses open source software, making experimental results reproducable and validatable.
And this is a **big** difference with how research in these areas is now often done.
