After asking about it, Tom explained me how [Taverna](http://taverna.sf.net/) can pick
up the `apiconsumer.xml` file from jars: just copy it into the root directory of the jar package. Easy as that.

So, users now only need to copy the `cdk-taverna.jar` into the `taverna-workbench-1.3/lib/` directory and have a nice chemoinformatics
workbench environment. I'll upload the jar to [CDK's project page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdk) right now.
