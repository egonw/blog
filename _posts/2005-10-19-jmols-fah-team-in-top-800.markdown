The [Jmol FAH team <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/Folding_At_Home_Community) has just entered the Top 800 of most active
[Folding@Home <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://foldingathome.org/) teams. And they started monitoring contributions on a user level. Thus, I can now see how active
I am within the team. And so can you! Join the team, and let's get into the Top 500!
