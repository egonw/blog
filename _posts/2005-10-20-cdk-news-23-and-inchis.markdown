[CDK News](http://almost.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cdk/cdk_top/cdk_news/) 2.3 is scheduled for this month, and origanally
planned to be distributed on the CDK5AW event. So, it's a bit late. But the editorial process is converging... I realized that
I forgot to mention the requirement for [InChI](http://www.iupac.org/inchi/)'s whenever molecules are given. So,
I'm now in the process of going through the issue and add the missing identifiers...
