This week there was an interesting article in the Dutch [Intermediar](http://intermediair.nl/) about viagra. They cite an article in
[Environmental Conversation](http://www.swetswise.com/eAccess/viewTitleIssues.do?titleID=68609) and state that it saves the environment
as it greatly reduced the market for animal parts from the traditional chinese medicine that address the same problem as viagra does.

*Viagra: good for the environment, good for you! ;)*

You don't see this often, though. Public opinion, at least in my social environment, is that chemicals (in general) are bad for the environment,
what so ever... Natural products are much better. Wait, those are chemical too... but that is to complicated for most :(
