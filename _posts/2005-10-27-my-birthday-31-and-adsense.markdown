Today is my 31st birthday, nearing half-point now (statistically seen). Also, by now I should have had my scientific moment of glory, otherwise I can forget that Nobel prize. Oh well, forget it.

Have you seen those small advertisements on this page (RSS users, please visit the website :)? Funny links they give. The system is very nice btw: it awaits google indexing of the blog and then decides which ads are relevant. Hence, the links to small chemoinformatics companies. Nice to browse.

Disclaimer, when clicking any or all of the ads, I'll get a bit of money. But don't start clicking away, otherwise Adsense will get upset, and then I get nothing.
