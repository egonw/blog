I just [read](https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/kubuntu-file-search) that the [Kubuntu](http://www.kubuntu.org/) team
[wants](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KubuntuFileSearchWithKat) to include [Kat](http://kat.mandriva.com/) in the
[dapper](http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/) release (scheduled for April 2006). Kat is (to be) the KDE equivalent of Google's desktop search bar.

This is great news for us chem-bla-icians, as Kat has support for full text searching of chemistry files! Let's see if I can get the Kubuntu team
to package up [kfile_chemical](http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=28995) too, which will extend Kat (and KDE in general), with
extraction of meta data from chemical documents.
