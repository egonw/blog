The great thing about open source is that... it's open.

When I was browsing the internet just now, I dropped in on [KDE Dot News](http://dot.kde.org/). In the rightside column, there is a feed of
new KDE software from [KDE-apps.org](http://www.kde-apps.org/). A new version of my favoriate music player,
[amarok](http://amarok.kde.org/), lured me to the KDE-apps website, where I saw [rkward](http://rkward.sf.net/) is latest announcement. The funny
name, and the categorization as scientific, triggered some interest on my side, and it turned out to be a graphical frontend to my favorite statistics program,
[R](http://www.r-project.org/).

Ok, they had a [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) package, and the debian/ build dir in the tar.gz so I downloaded it and started making a
[Kubuntu 5.10 package](http://www.woc.science.ru.nl/devel/egonw/rkward_0.3.4_i386.deb). While doing this I saw some notice about the R syntax highlighting
used, which conflicts with the older version in the Kate packages.

Then I realized that a long time ago, I wrote such syntax highlighting for Kate, so my attention was lured again. And, indeed, they use my syntax highlighting,
though [extended later](http://www.uni-kiel.de/agrarpol/ahenningsen/index-e.html) (somewhere down the page).

And this makes me happy. The syntax highlighting was useful to me in the past, but apparently to a lot of other people too. And because I released it
as GPL, back then, it now appears in rkward! Yes, a really like open source :)
