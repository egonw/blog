Thanx to [Mark's encouragements](https://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2005/11/goal-live-chemblaics-cd.html?showComment=1132422120000), I tried to run
[Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/) and [JChemPaint](http://jchempaint.sf.net/) with
[jamvm](http://jamvm.sourceforge.net/).

Jmol fails with an [NullPointerException](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2005/11/goal-live-chemblaics-cd.html), but JChemPaint runs! And note that
this was not even running with the latest of the latest; just recent packages from Kubuntu! Yes, there are some glitches, but I'm happy nevertheless!
