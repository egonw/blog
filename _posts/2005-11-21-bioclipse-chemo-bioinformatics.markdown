Some weeks back there was the [CDK5AW](http://almost.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cdk/cdk_top/events/cdk5yearworkshop/), the CDK 5th anniversiry
workshop. A small group of international open source chemo-, bioinformatics software developers met,
among which two from Sweden. It was then decided to generalize their work resulting in Bioclipse:

It's heavily using the [Eclipse Rich Client Platform](http://www.eclipse.org/rcp/), making additional plugins trivial. OK, if this does
not convinve you: check the screenshots on the Bioclipse website.

It's a killer, really! Ola, Martin: great work!

PS. I am going to try to run it with free Java virtual machines this weekend, but if you have a working solution earlier than that, please leave a comment and screenshot in the comments.
