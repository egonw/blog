Today I setup a blog planet for [Blue Obelisk](http://www.blueobelisk.org/) members. First I tried
Chumpologica but it did not read Atom feeds.

Next in line was [Planet](http://planetplanet.org/), which turned out to be used by many big planet sites, like
[Planet Debian](http://planet.debian.net/). It also works with Atom feeds in general, but not well with Atom 1.0 feeds, like that of
[Carsten](http://www.livejournal.com/users/cniehaus/). After some googling I found a
[patched version](http://lists.planetplanet.org/pipermail/devel/2005-November/000710.html) which did the job.

The result is at [http://www.woc.science.ru.nl/planetbo/](http://www.woc.science.ru.nl/planetbo/),
but I hope that someone can arrange a http://planet.blueobelisk.org/.
