[Getting Started with Eclipse and the SWT](http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~eclipse/) is a very nice set of introductory tutorial on working
with SWT and Eclipse in general. The tutorials cover the [basic](http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~eclipse/2-Basic.pdf),
[advanced](http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~eclipse/3-Advanced.pdf) SWT widgets,
[SWT layout](http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~eclipse/4-Layouts.pdf), and several other interesting topics.

Now that [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) is gaining speed, it is a must-read.
