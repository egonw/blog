[KDE](http://www.kde.org/) 3.5 was [released](http://dot.kde.org/1133270759/) with
[lots of changes](http://www.kde.org/announcements/visualguide-3.5.php). SuperKaramba is now a standard
KDE application and is neatly integrated. It allows embedding themelets on your desktop background.

It shows several themelets: the weather, a calender, a toolbar with applications, a
[FoldingAtHome monitor <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20060127053003/http://wiki.jmol.org/FoldingAtHomeCommunity),
the contents of the clipboard, the music that is playing
([Cake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_(band))) and a simple todo list. All customizable up to the pixel.

And before I forget: a nice new [Kalzium](http://edu.kde.org/kalzium/) release!
