After requests I added yesterday more visible the RSS and Atom feeds for the
[Planet Blue Obelisk](http://www.woc.science.ru.nl/planetbo/). They are linked in the menu
on the right, and as alternative links to the document. These should show up in most recent webbrowsers as feed icon in the
lower right corner of the browser window. It is often an orange icon. I also added a 'Leave a comment' link to encourage
people to leave comments on items. Please do!
