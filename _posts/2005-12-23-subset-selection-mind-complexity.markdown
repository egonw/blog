In a recent [JCIM](http://pubs.acs.org/journals/jcisd8/) article, Schuffenhauer [compares](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci0503558) a few subset selection
methods, and notes that some of them reduce the average complexity of the molecules. They put this in relation to other research that states that
lead compounds with high complexity have higher activities. Recommended reading material for the holidays.
