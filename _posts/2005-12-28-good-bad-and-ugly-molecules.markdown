Derek Lowe is the author of the blog [In the Pipeline <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20051229035537/http://corante.com/pipeline/) which is really fun to read. Derek works in
pharmaceutical industry and gives a great insight in how things work in that field of molecular sciences. Yesterday he blogged about
[What Makes an Ugly Molecule? <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20080611192217/http://www.corante.com/pipeline/archives/2005/12/27/what_makes_an_ugly_molecule.php), and touches the
Rule-of-Five, the hydrochloric acid bath (aka stomach), and other reasons that make molecules ugly.

But there are many other interesting posts, and, something that my blog still lacks, comments by many users, discussing the ideas he
posts, making his blog even nicer.
