Today I received news on the [Jmol user list](http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=23629) that Lubert Stryer's
[Biochemistry](http://www.whfreeman.com/stryer/) replaced the [proprietary Chime](http://www.mdli.com/products/framework/chemscape/) with the open source
[Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/). The third edition from which I learned biochemistry in my first year at the university did not feature a CD with live
figures, but I am very thrilled to see a program on which I have actively programmed hit a text book I used myself in the past.
