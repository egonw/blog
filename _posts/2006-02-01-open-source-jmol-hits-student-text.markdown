Today I received news on the [Jmol user list](http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=23629) that Lubert Stryer's
[Biochemistry <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/product/Biochemistry/p/1319333621) replaced the
[proprietary Chime <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDL_Chime) with the open source
[Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/). The third edition from which I learned biochemistry in my first year at the university did not feature a CD with live
figures, but I am very thrilled to see a program on which I have actively programmed hit a text book I used myself in the past.
