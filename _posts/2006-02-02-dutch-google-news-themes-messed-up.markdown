Recently, a [Dutch version of Google News](http://news.google.nl/) was started, and might mean a replacement for
[nu.nl](http://nu.nl/). I do not like the verbose layout much, because it makes it more difficult to scan headlines.
I do like the themes. Except for one.

The English theme 'Sci/Tech' is Wetenschap in the Dutch version, or plain Science. And it annoys me to read IT headlines
when looking up scientific news. Is a IE 7 beta really science, or did the translators mess up? (If any Google employee
is reading this: please split up those two themes.)
