I never got around to mentioning this blog, but [YAKAFOKON](http://plindenbaum.blogspot.com/) is a nice blog about, as the
titel already says, bioinformatics, the semantic web and social networks. Nice to read, and interesting comments on the
function and features of the internet and how they relate to bioinformatics, and science in general. Recommended!
