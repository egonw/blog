If you have read [my previous post](/blog/2006/02/06/blog-about-bioinformatics-semantic-web.html)
and visited that other blog, you might have noted the [Technorati keywords](http://web.archive.org/web/20060207020403/http://www.technorati.com/tags/).
Or tags, really, as explained in this [rel="tag"](http://microformats.org/wiki/reltag) microformat. Adding them
to blog items, will enable indexing by Technorati, one of the bigger blog search engines. So, from now on,
you'll see these tags in my items too, hoping they don't get annoying. No idea, btw, how blog planets respond to them...
For the record, the tags I list below are general for my blog, and not for this blog item specifically.
