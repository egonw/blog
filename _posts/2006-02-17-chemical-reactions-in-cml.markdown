Gemma Holiday's article on CMLReact was published in the january issue of the [JCIM](http://pubs3.acs.org/acs/journals/toc.page?incoden=jcisd8)
(doi:[10.1021/ci0502698](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci0502698)), which seems to be marked as sample issue right now. She used CMLReact as data format for
[MACiE <i class="fa-solid fa-link-slash fa-xs"></i>](http://www-mitchell.ch.cam.ac.uk/macie/) (see doi:[10.1093/bioinformatics/bti693](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bti693)), a
database of 100 enzyme reactions, with fully annotated reaction mechanisms, making this an remarkable and insightfull database.

Now, the nice thing is that this CML should be readable and renderable by the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/), though the webinterface uses
SVG and can be used using [FireFox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) too.
