As of April 3, I will be working as postdoc in the group of
[Christoph Steinbeck <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6966-0814) at the
[Cologne University BioInformatics Center <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](http://web.archive.org/web/20090614125847if_/http://www.cubic.uni-koeln.de:80/),
or simply CUBIC, for a year. Though no exact plans have been decided upon, the work will include [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/),
[CML](https://www.xml-cml.org/), ontologies, [Bioclipse](https://www.bioclipse.net/), semantic web
technologies, [Jmol](https://www.jmol.org/), and other interesting things. Research areas will at least
include [QSAR](https://qsar.sf.net/), but I hope to touch bits of bioinformatics too.
