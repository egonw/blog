As of April 3, I will be working as postdoc in the group of [Christoph Steinbeck](http://almost.cubic.uni-koeln.de/jrg/)
at the [Cologne University BioInformatics Center](http://www.cubic.uni-koeln.de/), or simply CUBIC, for a year. Though
no exact plans have been decided upon, the work will include [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/), [CML](http://www.xml-cml.org/),
ontologies, [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/), semantic web technologies, [Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/), and other
interesting things. Research areas will at least include [QSAR](http://qsar.sf.net/), but I hope to touch bits of
bioinformatics too.
