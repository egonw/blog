Internet has the nice feature of bringing together people. This has helped many open source projects in the past. But it is also a
convenient and cheap way to have conferences. Next month, the [ChemConf 2006](http://www.ched-ccce.org/confchem/)
conference will be held, and interested people only need to subscribe to a mailing list to participate.

The topic of this years ChemConf is Web-Based Applications for Chemical Education. At least three posters will show the use of
Java applets in chemistry education, using [Jmol](https://jmol.org/), [JChemPaint](http://jchempaint.sourceforge.net/) and
[JSpecView](http://jspecview.sourceforge.net/). I am (co-)author of two of them.

Again, participation is free. So join in!
