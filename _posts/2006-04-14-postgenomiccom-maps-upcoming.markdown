Conference season is nearing. And just in time, [Postgenomic.com](/http://postgenomic.com/) added
a [conferences map](http://postgenomic.com/meetings.php) showing locations of upcoming and
recently finished conferences. Oh boy, do I want to set this up for chemoinformatics too!

Postgenomic.com makes use of the [rel="conference" attribute](http://postgenomic.com/about_reviews.php) for the
`<a>` element. I'm not sure how they distinguish between upcoming and finished conferences (will need to check the
[source code](http://postgenomic.org/)). But I think some manual
processing is done, for example, to extract conference details, like title, location and dates. I assume the URL is used as unique identifier. Additionally,
the conferences are not 'tagged' yet, which should be possible too, as Postgenomic.com already associates tags from blog items with articles mentioned in
that item. But this is likely a temporary ommision.

I already saw [ChemConf2006](http://www.ched-ccce.org/confchem/) [picked up](http://postgenomic.com/meetings.php#conference_id_6) from an
[earlier post](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2006/04/free-online-chemconf-2006-conference.html) by me. Unfortunately, because it is an online conference,
it does not show up on tha map :( The following two conference do have a physical location, and I hope the will appear on the map. If you wonder why I mention
only these two, they are the two I will attend in the next 8 weeks, and will have presence of open source bio- and chemoinformatics software developers
(at least one, me).
