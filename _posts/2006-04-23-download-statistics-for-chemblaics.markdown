Here are some quick download statistics for some of the chemblaics components. First
[Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/). The new stable Jmol 10.2 was release just over a week ago, and this obviously boosted downloads,
breaking the monthly download total of two earlier this year ([source](http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=23629&ugn=jmol&type=&mode=alltime)):

Statistics for the CDK include download numbers for the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) library itself, but for [JChemPaint](http://jchempaint.sf.net/),
the CDK News, and several other packages too. Totals are at about 1/3rd of Jmol. Another new record, breaking an earlier record set in February 2003
([source](http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=20024&ugn=cdk&type=&mode=alltime)):

Finally, I want to mention the overall download count for [kfile_chemical](http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=28995)
was is much higher than I ever would have hoped for: 1125 in 7 months! Maybe I should ask to get this in the
[KDE](http://www.kde.org/) extragear.
