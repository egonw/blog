[Rajarshi Guha](http://blue.chem.psu.edu/~rajarshi/) has set a [nightly build service](http://blue.chem.psu.edu/~rajarshi/code/java/nightly/)
for the [Chemistry Development Kit](http://cdk.sf.net/) (CDK). The output is pretty, but information rich: it includes results for the
[JUnit test](http://www.junit.org/), [DocCheck](http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/doccheck/), and [PMD](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/).
The compiled jar and the corresponding JavaDoc can be downloaded, offering a cutting edge distribution for users.
