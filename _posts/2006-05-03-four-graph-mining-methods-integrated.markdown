[Joerg Wegner](http://www.blogger.com/profile/2366764) [mentioned in his blog](http://miningdrugs.blogspot.com/2006/05/molecule-mining-field-is-rapidly.html)
the graph mining program [ParMol](http://www2.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Forschung/Projekte/ParMol/?language=en) which integrates four mining algorithms:
[MoSS](http://fuzzy.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~borgelt/moss.html) (aka MoFa) and [Gaston](http://www.liacs.nl/~snijssen/gaston/), which I mentioned
[in November last year](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2005/11/open-source-data-mining-in.html), and FFSM and gSpan, which I did not know about
yet. ParMol provides a common interface to the four different algorithms and is, like the four mining modules, licensed GPL. An interesting aspect
is that Gaston was originally written in C++.
