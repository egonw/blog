[mentioned in his blog](http://miningdrugs.blogspot.com/2006/05/molecule-mining-field-is-rapidly.html)
the graph mining program [ParMol <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20070609221004/http://www2.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Forschung/Projekte/ParMol/?language=en)
which integrates four mining algorithms:
[MoSS](http://fuzzy.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~borgelt/moss.html) (aka MoFa) and [Gaston](http://www.liacs.nl/~snijssen/gaston/), which I mentioned
[in November last year <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2005/11/02/open-source-data-mining-in.html),
and FFSM and gSpan, which I did not know about
yet. ParMol provides a common interface to the four different algorithms and is, like the four mining modules, licensed GPL. An interesting aspect
is that Gaston was originally written in C++.
