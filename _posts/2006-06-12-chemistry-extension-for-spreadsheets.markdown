Just wanted to make sure this news made it to the [Blue Obelisk Planet](http://www.blueobelisk.org/planetbo) too:
[David Strumfels](http://www.blogger.com/profile/21711372) reported that
[he extended MS-Excel with CDK functionality](http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2006/06/processing-usefulchem-molecules-with.html).
I wonder how difficult it would be to do this with [Kspread](http://www.koffice.org/kspread/) or
[Gnumeric](http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/)?
