The Dutch version of the [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc), [Programmeerzomer.nl](http://www.programmeerzomer.nl/),
announced today the five students participating. I was happy to see that Rob Schellhorn was selected with his project proposal for a
[Ghemical](http://bioinformatics.org/ghemical/ghemical/) plugin for [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/). Like in the Google
original, both the student and the mentoring organization are funded, 3600 and 400 euro respectively.
