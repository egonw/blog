David Strumfels posted news [about the Useful Chemistry CMLRSS feed <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20061011100407/http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2006/07/cml-in-rss-feeds.html).
He explains how this feed can be accessed using [Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/) and [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/). The latter are accompanied by two AVI
movies: [one about creating a new OPML file](http://showme.physics.drexel.edu/usefulchem/Software/bioclipse/CreatingAnOPML.avi), and
[one about accessing the CMLRSS file from the OPML](http://showme.physics.drexel.edu/usefulchem/Software/bioclipse/UsingAnOPML.avi).
