[Technorati](http://technorati.com/) is nice in several ways, one being the feature to set up a [watchlist](http://technorati.com/watchlist/).
I have set watches on *chemoinformatics, Jmol, Bioclipse* and a few more. This allows me see the latest blog items on these topics. Often,
the point to Asian blogs, mostly Chinese and Japanese, which I mostly find hard to read. Funny characters with *Jmol* somewhere in the sentence :)

Yesterday, I found this way a rather interesting Japanese blog, called [ケムインフォマティクスに虚空投げ](http://cheminformatics.seesaa.net/),
which I still can't read, but which has a lot of small code fragments. (Can someone please translate the title for me??) The last 10-ish items
discuss fingerprints calculation with the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) and [JOELib](http://joelib.sf.net/), some SMARTS work with JOELib, and some
discussion on neural network tools.
