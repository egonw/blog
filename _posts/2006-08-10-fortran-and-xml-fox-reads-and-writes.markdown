Mix one of the oldest and one of the latest computer technologies, and you get [FoX](http://www.uszla.me.uk/software/FoX.html)
(BSD license), a [Fortran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) library for reading and writing [Chemical Markup Language](http://www.xml-cml.org/),
and thus [XML](http://www.w3.org/XML/). Amazing, what Toby White achieved, though he did not start from scratch:
*"FoX evolved from the initial codebase of [xmlf90](http://lcdx00.wm.lc.ehu.es/ag/xml/), which was written largely by Alberto
Garcia and Jon Wakelin."* (source: [cml-discuss mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=cml-discuss)).
