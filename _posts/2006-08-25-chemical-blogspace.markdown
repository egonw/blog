We all know [chemical space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_space); [Chemical blogspace](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/pg/) (Cb) is different:
it is the chemistry discussed in [blogspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogspace). Cb is build on the
[opensource software](http://postgenomic.org/) of [Postgenomic.com](http://postgenomic.com/) which I bloged on
[before](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2006/02/hot-articles-mining-semantic-web.html). The now running Cb aggregates
[19 blogs](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/pg/all_blogs.php) and, like the original, extracts linked (cited or reviewed) articles from literature.

The system is beta, but I am happy about it already that I mention it now. For example, some article titles are not properly recognized,
and some journals are known in the statistics in several formats. And, more importantly, I have not yet hooked in the
[InChI](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2006/02/hacking-inchi-support-into.html) support I developed earlier.

So, if you like the idea, or know other interesting scientifically interesting chemistry blogs, leave a comment, or send me email.
