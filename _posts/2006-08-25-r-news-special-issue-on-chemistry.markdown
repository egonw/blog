[R News](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/) just released a [special issue](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2006-3.pdf) on
the use of the versatile statistics program [R](http://www.r-project.org/) in chemistry. It features six articles amongst which one by
Rajarshi Guha on the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/)-R bridge, and one by my supervisor and me on the use of self-organizing maps to
cluster crystal structures.
