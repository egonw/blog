[Martin Szugat reported](http://www.bioservices.net/2006/09/biojava-15-beta-released.html) that a beta for [BioJava 1.5](http://biojava.org/wiki/BioJava:Download)
has been released. New features include: a new [biojavax](http://www.biojava.org/docs/api15b/index.html) package with extension on the basic functionlity, such as
the `RichSequence.IOTools` and the `RichSequence` object; a [genetic algorithm library](http://biojava.org/wiki/BioJava:BioJavaXDocs#Genetic_Algorithms); features
that allow manipulation of 3D structure files and objects; and non-HMM implementations of the NW and SW alignment algorithms. The announcement also mentions a new
package for handling external processes (org.biojava.utils.process); I am wondering what that is about. I will upload this beta to Bioclipse
[trunk/bc_biojava/](http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bioclipse/trunk/bc_biojava/) shortly, so that we can play with it.
