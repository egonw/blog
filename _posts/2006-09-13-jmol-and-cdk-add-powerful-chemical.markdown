[Bernard Munos](http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/vaop/ncurrent/authors/nrd2131.html) at [Eli Lilly & Co.](http://www.lilly.com/)
wrote up a lengthy analysis on open source in drug discovery in [Nature Reviews Drug Discovery](http://www.nature.com/nrd/index.html):
Can open-source R&D reinvigorate drug research? (DOI:[10.1038/nrd2131](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd2131)). When scanning the article
I saw this quote:

*Other tools such as eMolecules, Jmol or the Chemistry Development Kit are adding powerful chemical search and visualization
capabilities to the open-source scientist's toolbox.*

Unfortunately, the paper does not point to the correct [CDK website](http://cdk.sf.net/), but to the CUBIC backend at
[http://almost.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cdk](http://almost.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cdk). Moreover, I don't think the quote does full justice to
what the CDK has achieved in the past six years; I'm sure we have achieved more than a fingerprinter and some 2D and 3D rendering!
