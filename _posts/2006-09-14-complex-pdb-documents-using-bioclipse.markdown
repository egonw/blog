Some time ago I blogged about the [ChildResourceCreator extension point in Bioclipse](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2006/08/bioclipse-gets-new-extension-point.html)
and hinted as using that for [PDB files](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/). which contain 3D molecular models, sequences and bibliographic information. Using the new extension point,
[Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) now treats PDB files as complex documents, creating child resources for the 3D molecular model (using the
[CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) plugin), and a sequence resource (using the [BioJava](http://www.biojava.org/) plugin).
