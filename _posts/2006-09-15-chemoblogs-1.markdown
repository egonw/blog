There are a number of links I wanted to blog about, but never really had time for yet. Here's a short review of a them.
[Bio::Blogs](http://bioblogs.wordpress.com/) is a series of summary/review articles of bio related blogs, and definately
worth putting in your aggregator. Maybe someone is interested in setting up a Chemo::Blogs for
[chemistry blogs](http://blueobelisk.org/pg/all_blogs.php)?

My [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) (social bookmarking) [network](http://del.icio.us/network/egonw) informed me about
[HTML Slidy](http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/), an XHTML based PowerPoint replacement. Being true XHTML, it allows
embedding [Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/), [JChemPaint](http://jchempaint.sf.net/) and any other applet. Embed your pieces
of CML, MathML and SVG (or any other [namespace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_namespace)) and you no longer
[have data loss <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2006/09/10/hamburgers-and-cows-the-cognitive-style-of-pdf/).

[Nucleic Acids Research](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/) recently had a special issue on webservers
(DOI:[10.1093/nar/gkl385](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkl385)), in which [Taverna <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://incubator.apache.org/projects/taverna.html)
was featured (DOI:[10.1093/nar/gkl320](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkl320)). Just want to mention once more that Taverna has
a chemoinformatics module: [CDK-Taverna](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=20024&package_id=166755).

Day and Motherwell published the paper *An Experiment in Crystal Structure Prediction by Popular Vote*
(DOI:[10.1021/cg060313r](https://doi.org/10.1021/cg060313r)). It links to a[ openaccess website](http://pubs.acs.org/isubscribe/journals/cgdefu/asap/objects/cg060313r/CSP_popular_vote.html)
to participate yourself. This is one way in which one have tigher integration of the internet with old-fashion publishing.

And some minor notes: a video tutorial was put online in [this blog](http://phobos.xtec.net/fmas/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=27)
that shows how Jmol is inserted on a Moodle page. And, as [Pierre reminded me](http://plindenbaum.blogspot.com/2006/08/life-sciences-semantic-web-is-full-of.html),
*The Life Sciences Semantic Web is Full of Creeps!* (DOI:[10.1093/bib/bbl025](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbl025)),
which puts me in an identity crisis: hacker, chemist or creep. Mmmm...
