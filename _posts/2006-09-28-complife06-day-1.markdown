[CompLife'06](http://www.inf.uni-konstanz.de/complife06/) started today in Cambridge, UK. About 80 people are attending the meeting,
and topics range from systems biology to QSAR. This evening there was a free software session mostly focussing on opensource software.
Twelve projects were presented, among which the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) (by me) and [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) (by Ola),
in five minute presentations, and a two hour demo period during a reception (free speech and free beer :). We had our brand new fliers
with us, as well as a large poster for some additional branding.

One research presentation compared a number of fingerprint implementations in a QSAR study, and CDK came out very well, beating a few
commercial programs. The free software session was full of CDK, however, with [AMBIT](http://ambit.acad.bg/),
[iBabel](http://openbabel.sourceforge.net/wiki/IBabel), Bioclipse and [KNIME](http://knime.org/) mentioning the CDK.

The latter is really interesting: it's a workflow program just like [Taverna](http://taverna.sourceforge.net/) or
[PipeLine Pilot](http://www.scitegic.com/products/overview/index.html), which is using the Eclipse RCP as starting point, just like
Bioclipse. And like the other two, KNIME has CDK integration, at least for displaying structures.
