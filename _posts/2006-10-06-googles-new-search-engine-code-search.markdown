[Google](http://www.google.com/) has set up a new search enginge specifically for source code:
[/* Code Search */](http://www.google.com/codesearch). Important difference with their normal search engine is that it
allows restricting your search by programming language, license and filename and package. I have not been able to figure
out how to use 'package' yet, but the others are pretty clear. For example: `AtomContainer license:LGPL lang:java`
should do it. The search results show filenames, licenses and programming languages:

Alternatively, you can use [Koders](http://www.koders.com/), which is a source code search engine too. It has been around
for quite some time now, and shows the copyright notice too. Additionally, Koders offers a
[plugin for Eclipse](http://www.koders.com/info.aspx?c=tools) which adds a search 'view' which will show the HTML from the
website in an editor window inside Eclipse.
