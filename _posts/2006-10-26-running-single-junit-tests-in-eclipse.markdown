Unit testing is important when developing source code. [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/) provides a library to facilitate this in Java,
and [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/te) had the functionality to run JUnit tests. Even better, it allows you to run single JUnit
tests, even in debug mode:

Just open the java class in your Package Explorer, right click on the JUnit method you want to run, then pick `Run As` or `Debug As`,
and then `JUnit test`.
