[Chemical Blogspace](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/pg/) is up and running fine for some time now. Since the
[start <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2006/08/25/chemical-blogspace.html) the number of aggregated blogs increased from 19 to
[64](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/pg/all_blogs.php) now, of which a number are situated at
[ChemBlogs](http://chemblogs.org/) which is a site where you can run a blog. Meanwhile, the number of
[cited papers](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/pg/all_papers.php) went up to 186! The
[JACS](http://pubs.acs.org/journals/jacsat/) is most popular so far, followed by the
[Angewandte Chemie Int. Ed.](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jhome/26737)

As mentioned [before <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2006/08/25/chemical-blogspace.html), the software was taken
[Postgenomic.com](http://postgenomic.com/), which has upgraded considerably and released new software since the author
[moved to Nature](http://www.ghastlyfop.com/blog/2006/09/changes.html), but I have not found time to follow that upgrade
yet :( The [promised InChI support <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2006/02/25/hacking-inchi-support-into.html)
is still pending too.
