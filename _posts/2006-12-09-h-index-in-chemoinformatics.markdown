[Peter](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/) [blogged](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=209) about the
[h-index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index), which is a measure for ones scientific impact. He used
[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/), but I do not feel that that database is clean enough. I believe a better
source would be the [ISI Web-of-Science](http://portal.isiknowledge.com/portal.cgi?DestApp=WOS&Func=Frame).

Therefore, I composed a list of h-indices of my own, ordered by value. The choice of authors is biased to the
[Blue Obelisk](http://www.blueobelisk.org/) and the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/), has some personal touches
([Buydens](http://www.cac.science.ru.nl/people/lbuydens/) are [Wehrens](http://www.cac.science.ru.nl/people/rwehrens/)
are my PhD supervisors) and some names that put the rest into perspective:

```
query		h-index	#pubs
BENDER A	41	222
WILLETT P	37	302
GASTEIGER J	33	212
RZEPA HS	25	236
BUYDENS LMC	18	108
GLEN RC		18	78
WEHRENS R	11	47
MURRAY-RUST P*	9	41
STEINBECK C	9	29
FECHNER U	6	12
GUHA R		4	24
WILLIGHAGEN E*	4	9
WEGNER JK	3	9
LUTTMANN E	2	4
```

Of course, there are many comments on this. Like any measurement, take into account the error. Sources of error
include, but are not limited to, ambiguity in the query. The most notable example of this, I think, is
[Andreas Bender](http://andygoesus.blogspot.com/); I don't think he has been *that* successful :) Also,
[Rajarshi Guha](http://cheminfo.informatics.indiana.edu/~rguha/)'s h-index was reported 6, but the list included
two articles from the 70-ies and 80-ies, which I do not think are actually really his.

Feel free to suggest other names, query corrections, tips, and I will add or work on those too.
