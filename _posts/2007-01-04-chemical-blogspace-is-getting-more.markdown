The best remedy for being depressed is the rush after hacking some nice new feature (unfortunately, it is addictive). After
[hacking InChI support into Chemical blogspace](http://chemicalblogspace.blogspot.com/2006/12/hacking-inchi-support-into-cb.html)
a couple of days back, adding some more visual feedback on [those molecules <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](http://web.archive.org/web/20070611160715/http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cb/inchis.php)
is not that hard, with [PubChem](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) around that is:

Beware! Every [marked up molecule <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2006/12/10/including-smiles-cml-and-inchi-in.html) in your
blog is being picked up! So should the compound with the SMILES N(=NC1=CC=C(C=C1)N(CCO)CCO)C3=CC=C(C=CC2=C(C(=C(C#N)C#N)OC2(C)C)C#N)S3,
which is [reported to be the most light sensitive molecule every synthesized so far
<i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](http://web.archive.org/web/20240915152205/https://www.sciencelink.net/verdieping/organische-chemie-versnelt-internet/9035.article).
