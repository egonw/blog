[Slashdot reported](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/02/15/1417236&from=rss) on
[D-Wave](http://www.dwavesys.com/)'s recent demo of their 16-[qubit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit)
quantum computing system. [Video's of the demo](http://kwc.org/blog/archives/2007/2007-02-14.dwave_demo.html)
can be watched on [Google Video](http://video.google.com/). The [second video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-291541120357804188&hl=en)
demonstrates the use of the machine in similarity searching:

Now, that screenshot does look like [Jmol](http://jmol.sf.net/).
The companies website does not give the answer, [though Scott mentions C and Java front end software](http://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=198).

So, let's ask the source: Dear dr. [Rose](http://dwave.wordpress.com/), is it Jmol what we see in that demo?
