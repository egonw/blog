[Jim](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/downing) reported about [SPECTRa](http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/183858)
[being in the news](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/downing/?p=79) and [./](http://www.slashdot.org/) about
[Toward a 3D Search Engine](http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/07/03/08/1638241.shtml). These two items have in
coming that they deal with the article *Ultrafast shape recognition for similarity search in molecular databases* by
Ballester and Richards (DOI:[10.1098/rspa.2007.1823](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2007.1823)). The NewScientist wrote
up [their angle on it](http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/dn11283-novel-search-engine-matches-molecules-in-a-flash.html),
with a quote from [Henry Rzepa](http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/local/organic/mod/).

The article proposes a new shape descriptor which is requires little computational resources to be calculated. It consists
of 12 numbers describing the shape, and a simple similarity measure converts it into similarities. The results shown in
the article, and replicated in the NewScientist article linked above, are interesting enough for me to wonder if I could
[Federico](http://cia.navi.cx/stats/author/f_marighetti), one of our [CUBIC](http://almost.cubic.uni-koeln.de/jrg/)
students, to work on this in the last two weeks of his practical.

BTW, [Andreas](http://andygoesus.blogspot.com/), don't those review articles (viz.
DOI:[10.1039/b409813g](https://doi.org/10.1039/b409813g)) work out good for your citation count ;)
