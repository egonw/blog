[QDIS](http://www.qdinformation.com/qdisblog) blogged about [Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca teaming up for a new drug called
dapagliflozin](http://www.qdinformation.com/qdisblog/2007/01/11/bristol-myers-and-astrazeneca-in-1-billion-drug-pact/). Now,
dapagliflozin is, this week, the most used search keyword in [Google](http://www.google.com/), leading to
[Chemical blogspace](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cb/).

I wondered what the chemical structure of this compound is. The [AstraZeneca](http://www.astrazeneca.com/) and
[Bristol-Myers Squibb](http://www.bms.com/) websites don't say. Since everything in pharma is patented I went to the US
patent database and a search for *DPP-4 AND inhibitor* found the patents [6,995,183](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=DPP-4&s2=inhibitor&OS=DPP-4+AND+inhibitor&RS=DPP-4+AND+inhibitor)
and [6,995,180](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=2&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=DPP-4&s2=inhibitor&OS=DPP-4+AND+inhibitor&RS=DPP-4+AND+inhibitor).
But that does not help me either.

Does anyone know the chemical structure of this compound? Just the InChI would be fine...
