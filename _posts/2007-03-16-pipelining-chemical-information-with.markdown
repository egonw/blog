Chemists are picking up [Yahoo Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/), or, as Noel calls them,
[Pipeline Pilot for RSS feeds](http://www.mail-archive.com/blue-obelisk@hardly.cubic.uni-koeln.de/msg00120.html).
I tend to agree, as the source of the workflows are closed, that is, at least require registering to the Yahoo webpage.

Several chemical applications have been developed since. One was developed by [Kermit](http://msblog.kermitmurray.com/)
who wrote an [aggregator for mass spectrometry journal articles](http://msblog.kermitmurray.com/2007/02/yahoo-pipes-mass-spectrometry.html).
And [Mitch](http://www.chemicalforums.com/index.php?action=profile;u=2) has set up a
[similar feature for ACS journals](http://www.chemicalforums.com/index.php?topic=13458.msg62253#msg62253).

Now, what I am really waiting for, are the first applications that deal with molecular structures, and a
pipe that alerts me about publications in which molecules are discussed matching a certain
[MQL molecular query for an interesting substructure](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci600305h).
