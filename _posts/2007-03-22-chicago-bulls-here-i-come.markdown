I had some fun today with making prints of reservations etcetera for my trip to the
[ACS conference in Chicago](http://www.chemistry.org/portal/a/c/s/1/acsdisplay.html?DOC=meetings%5Cchicago2007%5Chome.html).
Went over to the website to make a print of the location of the hotel I am in.
([Intercontinental Chicago](http://chicago.intercontinental.com/): in case you want to leave me a message to
meet up over breakfast or so.) Anyway, so at the ACS website I found a notice that the ACS Housing people
closed down and that I should contact the hotel directly. Fine, no problem. Oh wait, my hotel is not in the
list. No worries, I just enter my last name and acknowledgment number. Huh, they don't know me?? Already
worried about which bridge to use as backup alternative, I emailed the organization which now takes care
of it, being answered some 15 minutes later that they no longer do the hotel administration for that ACS
conference anymore. That indeed rang some bell; I went over back to the ACS webpage, and this time found
the correct ACS housing webpage. I had been using one from a previous ACS conference. Yeah, one of my
finest hours :) Things are sorted out now, as I had already email the hotel too. Things are fine, and so
my nerviness activity is back to normal. (If you care to reproduce, just go to the
[page for International Visitors](http://www.chemistry.org/portal/a/c/s/1/acsdisplay.html?DOC=meetings\national\international.html)
linked from the Chicago conference homepage, scroll down to "Preparing for Your ACS Meeting Experience" and click the
[Hotel Information link](http://www.chemistry.org/portal/a/c/s/1/acsdisplay.html?DOC=meetings\national\housing.html).
Makes sense, because the international guests already know how things work :) And, yes, I could have seen it mention
SA in the subtitle, I know.)

## My ACS Schedule

My schedule is pretty regular, filled mostly with CINF and COMP presentations. The Monday and and Wednesday
afternoons are empty, though there was some [plans to meet up with bloggers](http://chemicalblogspace.blogspot.com/2007/03/chemical-blogspace-getting-physical-at.html)
([and here](http://gaussling.wordpress.com/2007/03/07/bloggenvolk/)) on Monday afternoon, which I still
think we should do, even though [Gaussling had to back out](http://gaussling.wordpress.com/2007/03/19/bloggenvolk-acs-chicago-meeting-minus-gaussling/).
I hereby suggest we meet at 13:00 at [Laptop Lane on the ACS Show Floor](http://map.mapnetwork.com/tradeshow/chicago/acs/).
Sunday evening there are all sorts of parties, and I and some colleagues are going to the party for
international guests at the Sheraton Chicago. Monday evening is reserved for the [Bulls](http://www.nba.com/bulls/).
I am indeed some 10 years late, but happy to finally be able to visit a NBA stadium during the season. They play
against Portland on Monday, while against Detroit on Tuesday. I figure that game would have been nicer, but
Tuesday evening is reserved for the [Blue Obelisk](http://blueobelisk.org/) social event at the
[South Water Kitchen](http://hardly.cubic.uni-koeln.de/pipermail/blue-obelisk/2007-March/001125.html).

Suggestions, like [these from Carmen](http://blind-science.blogspot.com/2007/03/if-i-were-going-to-chicago.html)
are most welcome!
