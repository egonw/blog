I arrived in Chicago yesterday afternoon. Much warmed than the cold Chicago the ACS promised me,
so my winter coat was really not necessary. Is this global warming? Or was the ACS simply wrong?
Anyway, very foggy indeed, just like the [Chemistry World blog wrote](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cb/blog_search.php?timeframe=10y&blog_id=44):

There were several other Dutch chemists on the plane, among which a few formed postdocs from Nijmegen,
who I knew from the time I was still a M.Sc. student in organic chemistry. The plane was nice too, a
Boeing 747, the first time I flew with one. OK, there now is the new Airbus, so the Boeing has lost
some of its prestige, but here's the image anyway:

The [380 is actually supposed to be in Chicago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iTqwPj5ChE),
but I did not see it. OK, going for breakfast now, and to the ACS conference site afterwards.
