The wetter was much better today. This is a view on downtown from the walking bridge between Lake Side and McCormick
buildings of the conference site:

## CINF morning

Yeah, more CINF session reports; I'm a chemoinformatician, remember. Chen showed us around in the latest changes in
[ChemDB](http://cdb.ics.uci.edu/CHEM/Web/), such as retrosynthesis planning. Banik shows a patented method for
showing differences in a set of spectra, though his examples were not really impressive; if the method is really
powerful, the examples might have been picked a bit more careful. And I have to say, in retrospect, I found the
presentations in the CINF sessions typically of lower quality than I had expected for the big ACS meeting. Fortunately,
meeting all the people here makes more than up for that. Guha presented a potentially powerful method to cluster
large and huge data sets with a method that approximated SVD by splitting up the full matrices into many smaller ones.

## Laptop Lane

The idea was that us bloggers met up, but that did not quite work out. No problem though. Spoke about many things
with several people. [Peter](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/) pointed me to an email from Noel on getting
[blog comments on JACS/ChemComm/JCIM papers on the table of contents](http://chemicalblogspace.blogspot.com/2007/03/jacs-toc-featuring-your-review.html).
And somewhere that day, [Jean-Claude](http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/) pointed me to
[more chemistry in Second Life](http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2007/03/communicating-chemistry-at-acs.html)
(set up by [Beth](http://bethssecondlife.blogspot.com/)). Both are great follow ups on
[the blog/wiki session by CHED yesterday](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/03/acs-chicago-day-1.html)!
Around 17:00 we left for one of the receptions in the W hotel in one of the WOW rooms, though the view was not that spectacular:

## Bulls

I did not stay very long at the party, as I had to leave for the Bulls game against Portland. That was fun indeed!
If I knew my first breakfast was going to cost 22 dollar, I would have bought a better ticket, but now I had a
*Stand 1* ticket which is so high up in the stadium that even the security people had not idea where to send
me :) The view was still more than good enough to feel the pain/joy of the blocks and dunks-in-your-face:
