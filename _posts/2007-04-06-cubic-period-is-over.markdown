The end of the CUBIC has come, and so did the end of my 1-year postdoc in the group of [Christoph Steinbeck](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/blog/).
It would have been much better if the group could have continued for one or two more years, so that we could harvest the fruit of the work done in
the past years. Only having been group member since April 1 2006, I mostly contributed work to [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/)
(doi:[10.1186/1471-2105-8-59](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-8-59)), CMLSpect (submitted), and integrating Miguel's mass spectrum prediction
toolkit into SENECA (doi:[10.1021/ci000407n](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci000407n)) for structure elucidation. The latter topic is rather exciting
and when the method shows powerful enough, this will have a major impact on the field of [metabolomics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite).

BTW, importantly, my CUBIC email address is no longer valid, so please use one of my many other email addresses, e.g. my SourceForge one, or
my Gmail account.
