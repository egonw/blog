Last night, I [released CDK 1.0](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=20024) as the previous release candidate
did not show up new major problems. It is far from a perfect release (see these still [TODO](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cdkwiki/doku.php?id=cdk1.0)'s
and [Nightly](http://cheminfo.informatics.indiana.edu/~rguha/code/java/nightly/), run by
[Rajarshi](http://cheminfoclub.blogspot.com/)), but the core is pretty solid.

I would warmly thank everyone who has contributed to the project in one way or another (I worked more on maintainance than
implementing functionality), as it has been a great pleasure to make CDK releases. [OHLOH](http://www.ohloh.net/) runs a rather nice
developer [hall of fame for the CDK](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/380/analyses/latest/contributors). You'll see that
[Christoph](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/blog/)'s research group is the major contributor. User contributions, however,
are equally important and played a bug role in the quite [large set of JUnit tests](http://cheminfo.informatics.indiana.edu/~rguha/code/java/nightly/junitsummary.html)
we have now (3300+).

Another reason why this is an important milestone, is that it is the last release I am creating. I wrote on the user list:

> In advance of the actual CDK 1.0 release, thanx very much to all that contributed big *and* small ! It was a great 7 years of open source
> chemoinformatics development!

So, who wants to take over? Some one will have to. I, however, will put my focus on other things. Very likely involving the CDK, as there
are still many things I want to do. Some things I have on my list:

* the Java2D based 2D renderer/editor
* more accurate atom type perception
* more articles for CDK News
* the book "CDK for Dummies"
* improved structure generator
* validation
* ...
