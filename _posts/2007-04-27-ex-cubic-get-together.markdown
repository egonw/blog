Yesterday and today I was in Cologne to meet with other ex-CUBIC researchers from [Christoph](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/blog/)'s
[research group on chemoinformatics](http://almost.cubic.uni-koeln.de/jrg) (and [with Alexandr](http://kemistry-desktop.blogspot.com/2007/04/gsoc-meeting-with-alexandr.html)).
Not all former group members where there, but on the other hand we were complemented with Pascal:

(Yes, the sun was **very** bright :)

The program was consisted of a couple of group things, like making a short list of articles to write up in the next
few months. Yesterday evening ended in a very nice Biergarten called the [Altenberger Hof](http://www.kneipen-suche.com/koeln-altenberger_hof-2541.html).
