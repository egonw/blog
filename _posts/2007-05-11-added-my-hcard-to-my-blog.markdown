Getting back on microformats (see [yesterday](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/05/microformats-in-chemistry.html)),
I added my [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard) to the bottom of my blog:

I will likely populate it a bit more soon (after holiday in Sweden).

Now, if you had the Firefox plugin [Operator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4106) installed, you would
have my contact information show up in your FF toolbar, like this:

Note the 'Export Contact' button in the toolbar. This will automatically create a vCard which I can directly open in
my address book (I use the KDE addressbook). Very nice integration!

Now, I already asked the author how the plugin could be extended to support chemical microformats. Just think of the
feature "Export Molecule (137)" (e.g. to [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/)), when reading a HTML version of paper
in one of the [Project Prospect](http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/ProjectProspect/) enabled journals :)
