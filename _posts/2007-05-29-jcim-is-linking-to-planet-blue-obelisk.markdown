I use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to analyze the visitors of my blogs and of
[Planet Blue Obelisk](http://blueobelisk.org/planetbo/) too. Now, for the past couple of weeks, the webpage of the
[Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling](http://pubs.acs.org/journals/jcisd8/index.html) is
showing up as refering site:

What is going on here ?!?! This is really no fake, but cannot find an actual link when I visit the journal
webpage either...
