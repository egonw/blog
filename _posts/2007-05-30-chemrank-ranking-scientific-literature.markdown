[Mitch](http://blog.chemicalforums.com/) [just launched](http://www.chemicalforums.com/index.php?topic=17653)
[ChemRank](http://www.chemrank.com/), a website where we can comment on and vote thumbs up or down for scientific articles.
Good initiative I think. Some thoughts:

* please include the DOI for each article overview on the front page (see [why](http://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2007/04/add-quotes-from-postgenomic-and.html))
* make the content [opendata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data), e.g. using the [CC license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons)
* provide a means to refer to other literature to back up comments and ranking
* provide an API to make mashups (like that of [Chemical blogspace for use in Greasemonkey scripts](http://blueobelisk.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/blueobelisk/cb/trunk/interface/api.php?revision=11&view=markup))
* make the website source code opensource (JSON, RDF come to mind)
* use microformats where possible (for [Operator](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/4106) and FF3)
* at least provide means for tagging articles
* provide browsing by journal
* import articles from Connotea/NatureNetwork/etc

Please consider there as feature requests, and not as critique. Two of these are already listed in the
[developers wishlist](http://www.chemicalforums.com/index.php?topic=17653). I will likely come up with more later :)
