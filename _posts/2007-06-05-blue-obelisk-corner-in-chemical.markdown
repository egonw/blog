I just finished setting up a [Blue Obelisk](http://www.blueobelisk.org/) section for [Chemical blogspace](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cb/),
as future replacement for the current [Planet Blue Obelisk](http://www.blueobelisk.org/planetbo/) (unless someone wants to take over that webpage).
The only thing really missing is a RSS feed for [recent posts](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cb/posts.php?category=Blue%20Obelisk) for just
the [Blue Obelisk member blogs](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cb/blogs.php?category=Blue%20Obelisk) (BTW, just email me if you want to be
listed as BO member with your blog too; the BO community is very open!).

For now, you will have to do with [this page](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cb/index.php?category=Blue%20Obelisk):

An additional flaw is that it also shows molecules for other blogs.

***Update***: the RSS feed for a specific category was already available, but just not from the FireFox URL bar. Instead, it is
given on the right side of the posts page when you selected a category. Here a shortcut for the RSS for
[posts from the Blue Obelisk category](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cb/atom.php?category=Blue%20Obelisk&type=latest_posts).
