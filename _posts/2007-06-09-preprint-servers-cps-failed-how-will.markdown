Some 7 years ago, following successes in physics, [ChemWeb.com](http://chemweb.com/)
[launched the Chemistry Preprint Server (CPS)](http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=10870),
and [Warr evaluated](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci025627a) it in a JCIM article three years later.
She wrote about 'lessons learned', but the only one seemed to have been that chemistry was not
ready for it, as [the project shutdown in 2004](http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/lists/epc-l/msg00790.html).
The [archives are still available](http://www.sciencedirect.com/preprintarchive?url=/CPS),
fortunately, and you may find it amusing to look up my or some other submission.

Now, [Nascent wrote that Nature is setting up](http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2007/06/coming_soon_nature_precedings.html)
[Nature Precedings](http://precedings.nature.com/), which was earlier
[noted by Pedro](http://pbeltrao.blogspot.com/2007/06/nature-preceedings-pre-print-server-for.html).
The [official announcement](https://doi.org/10.1038/447614a) was published as an editorial in
Nature. This being a Nature initiative, and not focused on just chemistry, I am sure it will do
better than CPS. BTW, media coverage is [tracked in a social way](http://www.connotea.org/user/timo/tag/Precedings).

I might [request an test account](http://network.nature.com/groups/bioinformatics/notice/2007/06/08/nature-precedings-contributors-wanted);
I do have an old half-finished manuscript that I never got around to finishing. While still relevant,
it could use some community input; this preprint server would be the perfect tool. That's how my first
manuscript ended up on CPS too :)
