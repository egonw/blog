Last year the [Programmeerzomer.nl](http://www.programmeerzomer.nl/) sponsored one summer student to work on [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/)
(see the [announcement](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2006/06/dutch-summer-of-code-sponsors.html)). The Programmeerzomer is much like the
[Google Summer of Code where I mentor Alexandr](http://kemistry-desktop.blogspot.com/2007/04/chemical-semantic-desktop.html). However, it is much
smaller and oriented at just the [NL area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands): both the student and the mentor needs to be Dutch,
but the opensource project does not.

Rob worked last year on a [Ghemical plugin for Bioclipse](http://wiki.bioclipse.net/index.php?title=Ghemical_plugin) (see
[this interview in Dutch](http://www.programmeerzomer.nl/interviews/rob_schellhorn/_rp_links1_elementId/1_1257)). The architecture for doing
calculations (the Compute plugin) is still being used within several other plugins. This year I got assigned two students: one for
Bioclipse and one for [Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/).

I have no idea at this moment what ideas the students picked from the lists in the wikis (see the
[Jmol project idea](http://wiki.jmol.org:81/index.php/ProgrammeerZomer) and [Bioclipse idea](http://wiki.bioclipse.net/index.php?title=SummerOfCode)
lists). There is a meeting scheduled in the 25th.

The ideas include:
* Jmol
  * a SWT widget for Eclipse RCP-based application
  * [Pharmacophore rendering](http://wiki.jmol.org:81/index.php/SoCPharmacophores)
  * Support for PDB in XML
  * [Ajax-enabled JavaScript library](http://wiki.jmol.org:81/index.php/SoCAjaxJS) (for the applet)
* Bioclipse
  * [a validating CML editor](http://wiki.bioclipse.net/index.php?title=Validating_CML_editor)
  * [a GROMACS plugin](http://wiki.bioclipse.net/index.php?title=Gromacs_plugin)
  * [a sequence editor](http://wiki.bioclipse.net/index.php?title=Sequence_editor)
  * [webservices over Jabber's XMPP](http://wiki.bioclipse.net/index.php?title=SummerOfCode)
  * Beanshell and Jython scripting plugins

If you have a suggestion, it would be much appreciated if you can add that to the wiki pages linked above. Make sure to leave a comment to this blog item too, announcing the new idea!
