[The Seven stones](http://blog-msb.embo.org/blog/) wondered [what to do with a petaflop in science](http://blog-msb.embo.org/blog/2007/07/what_would_you_do_with_a_petaf_1.html),
in response to [Declan](http://www.declanbutler.info/blog/)'s [The petaflop challenge](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/448006a) in Nature.
Declan discusses in this commentary the increase in computing power and the necessity of parallel programming to make use of it.
Now, I do have some ideas (e.g. enumerating metabolomic space, mining the RDF graph of our collective biological and chemical
knowledge base for the one hundred most supported contradictions), but that is not what I want to talk about. It is this fragment
from Declan's piece:

> "I'm amazed at what he can do just using open-source libraries," [Horst Simon] says. Although there are exceptions, such as
> high-energy physics and bioinformatics, many labs keep their software development close to their chests, for fear that their
> competitors will put it to better use and get the credit for the academic application of the program. There is little

This is something that is very familiar to many of us: developing algorithms for scientific problems is not appreciated.
It worries me very much the way the scientific community currently deals with algorithms and data; it seems the community
does not care about correctness or improvement at all, as long as the result illustrates what they think the (bio)chemical
reality has to offer. At least, that is what effectively happens if they do no give proper credit to the scientific
importance of software development.

Of course, scientific credibility of software depends on the open source nature of the software:
"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow", [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/),
E.S. Raymond. Or, in more traditional wording: science, and scientific software, must be reproducible and/or
falsifiable. The [Blue Obelisk Movement](http://www.blueobelisk.org/) is trying to achieve this
(DOI:[10.1021/ci050400b](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci050400b)).

## The open source challenge

Therefore, I hereby challenge all experimental chemists in biologists to acknowledge the amount of scientific software
they already use, and give credit where credit is due. I challenge them to stand up and say that chemo- and
bioinformaticians provide the methods they rely on daily to achieve there goals. I challenge them to say that
they stand of the shoulders of scientific software developers.

The article should not have been called *The petaflop challenge*, but *The open source challenge*.
