Everyone of use knows that big pile of paper on your desk that contains the things we want to read, scan or just
browse. I even have [an electronic equivalent](http://del.icio.us/egonw/toread). Another pile contains leaflets
and glossy folders from conferences, like the [ACS meeting in Chicago](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/search?q=ACS+Chicago).
OK, going to get rid of those last ones, and will shortly put the links here.

The first leaflet is from [Chemistry Central](http://www.chemistrycentral.com/), one of the open access publishers.
Actually, not just open access as in free access, but open access as in freedom to reuse it. One things I noticed is this text:
*Our submission system also allows authors to upload figures and reactions schemes in ChemDraw or ISIS/Draw file formats*.
What about CMLReact and CML itself? Those are formats I can author with my [Blue Obelisk](http://www.blueobelisk.org/)
tools.

Then there is the proprietary [Sarchitect](http://www.strandls.com/sarchitect/) in the area of QSAR/QSPR/ADMET.
No idea about the scope or whatever. Oh, make sure to check out [QSAR world](http://www.qsarworld.com/),
where [Andreas](http://andygoesus.blogspot.com/) has a column too. I also have some information on the
[RSC Virtual Library](http://www.rsc.org/virtuallibrary) which provides free access to the RSC journals for
RSC member. But I am not. [Green Chemistry](http://www.epa.gov/greenchemistry) is nice for the environment,
of course, but according to the [EPA](http://www.epa.gov/), it's about more: *Cleaner, cheaper, smarter chemistry*.
Why, oh why, does this financial incentive have to be present all the time? Are we, humans, really that stupid?

I'm sure I had more advertorials, but these must have been the highlights.
