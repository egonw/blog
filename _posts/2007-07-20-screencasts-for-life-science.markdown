[Deepak](http://mndoci.com/blog/) blogged about [screencasting for bio topics](http://mndoci.com/blog/2007/07/18/bioscreencastcom-02/),
concentrated at [bioscreencast.com <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20070701050807/http://bioscreencast.com/)
of which he is co-owner. I guess it is like a YouTube for
bioinformatics thingies. [Jean-Claude](http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/) picked this up very quickly (seen on
[Cb](http://cb.openmolecules.net/)? At least I did.), and already uploaded a screencast,
[demoing JSpecView <i class="fa-solid fa-link-slash fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://bioscreencast.com/bsc_movwin.html*)
written by [Robert](http://wwwchem.uwimona.edu.jm:1104/chrl.html). I wonder if he will upload the
[screencasts he made for](http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2006/07/cml-in-rss-feeds.html)
[Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) too? (hint, hint ... :)

I have no idea if this site will be a success, but at least it has the right ingredients: tags, flash movies, clean UI, a
[blog to monitor technological changes and improvements](http://bioscreencast.wordpress.com/), and a page to
request screencasts (with voting). What I only miss is a one summary page for each screencast to which I can
easily link, for example for my [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/egonw) account.
