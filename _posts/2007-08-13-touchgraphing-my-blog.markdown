Via [SciFoo Planet <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20071101070909/http://www.lexical.org.uk/planetscifoo/)
(from [Partial immortalization <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://pimm.wordpress.com/2007/08/11/scifoo-links-visualized-by-touchgraph-google-browser/))
I learned about [TouchGraph Google](http://www.touchgraph.com/TGGoogleBrowser.html) (Peter
[brought it into Chemical blogspace](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=496)).
It's cool, though not open source. Here's the touch graph for my blog:

As you can see, plenty of [blogspot](https://www.blogspot.com) bloggers around me, among which,
in purple, [Useful Chemistry](http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/). Funny thing is, each time I
repeat the Google search, the output is different. Oh, and make sure to drag one of the halos
around; that will keep you procrastinating for the whole afternoon :)
