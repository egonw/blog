[Peter](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/) has been doing an excellent job in advocating [ODOSOS](http://blueobelisk.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/ODOSOS),
and one of his posts even [hit Slashdot](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/09/04/1341248).

Meanwhile, blogspace has been flooded with dislike of the [PRISM intiative](http://www.prismcoalition.org/) (e.g. see also the
[other Peter's blog](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/fosblog.html)). The website is so sad, it is almost funny again; but on second
thought, it is so sad, you wonder the world will end because of WOIII or because of a total halt of scientific progress. It's so sad,
it is hard to decide between the real webpage and [this parody](http://pisdcoalition.org/) which is the fake one.

Wiley seems to be the king of commercial exploitation. While the sue over 6 data points seemed to be an incident, they now try to get
their reading public pay twice for published material: once for reading the paper (well, if you exclude incidental,
oh-I-m-sorry-our-IT-department-messed-up attempts to have readers pay for open access papers; or was that another publisher?), and
[once for accessing the data (spectra) in that paper](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=554).
