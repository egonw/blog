All start is difficult. The ACS must know that, but [they still blame Google](http://blog.everydayscientist.com/?p=661).
In this blog, [Everyday Scientist](http://blog.everydayscientist.com/) mentions that the ACS RSS journal TOC feeds are
sometimes messed up. I noted that too, but lived with it. The ACS generally is a very professional organization, but
when I read they told ES that his Google RSS client was the problem, I just had to confirm his problems, hoping that
some ACS representative can relay the message to their IT department.

[Akregator](http://akregator.kde.org/) is the RSS client that I use, and I noticed the exact same problem ES noted:
every now and then, twice, three times a month, the RSS feeds for one journal give the content of another journal.
For example, I get the TOC of Chemical Reviews in the RSS feed of the [JCIM](http://pubs.acs.org/journals/jcisd8/index.html).
Things like that.

Now, because Akregator has absolute nothing to do with Google, it cannot be Google who is messing up the RSS feeds.
Because ES is having the same issues I have, it cannot be Akregator either. Ergo, it is the RSS feed system of the
ACS itself that is messed up.
