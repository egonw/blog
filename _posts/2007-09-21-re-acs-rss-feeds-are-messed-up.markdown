A couple of people now confirmed the [problem with the ACS journal RSS feeds <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/09/16/acs-rss-feeds-are-messed-up.html).

The feed for Chemical Biology shows 79 feed items and the first one was a *Environ. Sci. Technol.* paper. The first of the
108 papers listed in the feed for Molecular Pharmaceutics is a perp from *J.Phys.Chem.C.*
