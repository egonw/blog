A couple of people now confirmed the [problem with the ACS journal RSS feeds](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/09/acs-rss-feeds-are-messed-up.html).

The feed for Chemical Biology shows 79 feed items and the first one was a *Environ. Sci. Technol.* paper. The first of the
108 papers listed in the feed for Molecular Pharmaceutics is a perp from *J.Phys.Chem.C.*
