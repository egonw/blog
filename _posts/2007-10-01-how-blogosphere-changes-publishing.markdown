Peter [is writing up a 1FTE grant proposal <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2007/09/30/open-grant-writing-can-the-chemical-blogosphere-help-with-agents-and-eyeballs/) for someone to work
on the question how automatic agents and, more interestingly, the blogosphere are changing, no improving, the
dissemination of scientific literature. He wants our input. To make his work easy, I'll tag this item `pmrgrantproposal`
and would ask everyone to do the same (Peter unfortunately did not suggest a tag himself). Here are pointers to
blog items I wrote, related to the four themes Peter identifies.

### The blogosphere oversees all major Open discussion

* [Open Text Mining Interface and Bioclipse <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2006/05/07/open-text-mining-interface-and.html)
* [USPTO considers open source software prior art <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2006/01/11/uspto-considers-open-source-software.html)
* [New InChI software beta: license issues resolved and InChIKey <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/09/07/new-inchi-software-beta-license-issues.html)
* [SMILES to become an Open Standard <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/09/28/smiles-to-become-open-standard.html)

### The blogosphere cares about data

* [Uncertainty in NMR based 3D protein models <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2006/04/02/uncertainty-in-nmr-based-3d-protein.html)
* [re: ACS RSS feeds are messed up <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/09/21/re-acs-rss-feeds-are-messed-up.html)
* [Molecules in Wikipedia without InChIs <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/08/11/molecules-in-wikipedia-without-inchis.html)

### Important bad science cannot hide

I do not feel much like pointing to bad scientific articles, but want to point to the enormous amount of literature
being discussed in [Chemical blogspace](http://cb.openmolecules.net/papers.php):
60 *active* chemical blogs discussed just over 1300 peer-reviewed papers from
213 scientific journals in less than 10 months. The top 5 journals have 133, 78, 68, 57 and 48 papers discussed in
22, 24, 10, 11 and 18 different blogs respectively. (Peter, if you need more in depth statistics, just let me
know...)

Two examples where I discuss not-bad-at-all scientific literature:

* [Automatic Classification of thousands of Crystal Structures <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/08/24/automatic-classification-of-thousands.html)
* [CDK Literature #2 <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/07/14/cdk-literature-2.html)

### Open Notebook Science

I regularly blog about the chemoinformatics research I do in my blog. A few examples from the last half year:

* [CDK Workshop - Days #3 and #4 <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/02/03/cdk-workshop-days-3-and-4.html)
* [Weka Decision Trees to Java Conversion <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/05/30/weka-decision-trees-to-java-conversion.html)
* [RDF-ing molecular space <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/07/31/rdf-ing-molecular-space.html)
* [Atom typing in the CDK <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/07/01/atom-typing-in-cdk.html)
* [Further Bioclipse QSAR functionality development <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/07/26/further-bioclipse-qsar-functionality.html)
