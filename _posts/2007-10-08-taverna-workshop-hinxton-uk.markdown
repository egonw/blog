I arrived at the [EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) last night for the [Taverna](http://taverna.sf.net/) workshop, during which the design
of Taverna2 is presented and workflow examples are discussed. Several 'colleagues' from Wageningen and the SARA computing center
in Amsterdam are present, along with many other interesting people. This afternoon is my presentation.

Paul Fisher just presented his PhD work on using workflows to improve the throughput of QTL matching against pathway information and
phenotype. One interesting note was its function to make biological informational studies more reproducible. He had getting the
versions of online databases explicitly in the workflow, so that it gets stored in workflow output.
