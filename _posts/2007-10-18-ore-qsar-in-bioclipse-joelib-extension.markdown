I added a [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) plugin for [JOELib](http://joelib.sourceforge.net/) (GPL, by
[Joerg](http://miningdrugs.blogspot.com/)) which comes with many QSAR descriptors, several of which are now
available in the [QSAR feature of Bioclipse](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/07/further-bioclipse-qsar-functionality.html):

Meanwhile, the [Bioclipse team in Uppsala](http://bioclipse.blogspot.com/) has set up the obligatory
scatter plot functionality, but leave that screenshot for them to show. Therefore, time for integration
with [R](http://www.r-project.org/).
