That must be a record! Eric Jain wrote on [public-semweb-lifesci](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-semweb-lifesci/):

```
The latest release of the UniProt protein database contains just over a
billion triples*! PRESS RELEASE :-)

The data is all available via the (Semantic or otherwise) Web:

  http://beta.uniprot.org/

...or can be bulk-downloaded from:

  ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/

* Counting some reification statements, and assuming no overlap between
"named graphs".

P.S. This should be the last you'll hear from me on this topic -- I'm off
to new adventures...
```

I surely hope this is not the last we hear of this huge RDF collection.
