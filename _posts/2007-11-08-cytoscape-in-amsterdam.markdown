Right at this moment I am listening to Andrew Hopkins from Dundee on chemical opportunities in system biology, at the
[Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) [conference in Amsterdam <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20071214220051/https://cytoscape.org/retreat2007/programme.php#nov_8).
Anyone who wants to meet up over lunch or coffee break?
