On my desktop, the [Scintilla](http://scintilla.nature.com/) and [Postgenomic.com](http://postgenomic.com/) websites
do not work. It is not a browser problem, but has something to do with TCP/IP packages not reaching its destination:
the browser. Euan told me they are aware of the problem, but apparently have not found a solution yet.

However, my [Wii](http://wii.nintendo.com/) does not have the problem, which makes me wonder if it is a disagreement
between the [Nature](http://www.nature.com/) server and my [Linux kernel](http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/metapackages/linux)...
Anyway, this is what the two website look like (first Scintilla, then Postgenomic.com):

(BTW, that was one [very nice piece of work by Rich <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://doi.org/10.59350/v4pc6-9v569)!
Make sure to also read the [follow up <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://doi.org/10.59350/vhefz-rc472)).

The only real disadvantage is that it does not integrate well with the things I do daily. If I see some interesting
post, and would like to tag it on [my del.icio.us account](http://del.icio.us/egonw), I have to google for it on
my desktop :(

(You thought I was going to talk about [F@H](http://folding.stanford.edu/) or so, didn't you? :)
