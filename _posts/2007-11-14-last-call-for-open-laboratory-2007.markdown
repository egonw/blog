[Pedro](http://pbeltrao.blogspot.com/) [reminded me](http://pbeltrao.blogspot.com/2007/11/last-call-for-open-laboratory-2007.html)
of the last call for [Open Laboratory 2007](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/11/open_laboratory_2008_last_call.php),
which prints the best blog items of 2007 in book form. The list of chemistry contributions is not so large yet, so
[go ahead and nominate](http://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/) some of cool chemical blog items of the last year.

I will post my shortlist later this week.
