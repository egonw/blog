I recently saw that blogger.com blogs gained [a poll feature](http://buzz.blogger.com/2007/07/polls-out-of-draft.html).
From now on, I will try to be a bit more Open Science, in addition to Open Source. From now on, *you* can be in my
Advisory Board. To do so, vote on my next chemblaics (aka Open Source Chemoinformatics) project. The poll can be found on
the left side of this blog. Associated which each poll, which I may run more or less frequently depending on the time of
year, will be one blog post where I introduce the options. Options not mentioned, or completely different things,
you would like to suggest me to do, can be left as comments to these items.

## Finishing the new JChemPaint code
Goal of this option is to use the [code written by Niels](http://progz-jchem.blogspot.com/) in his
[ProgrammeerZomer](http://www.programmeerzomer.nl/) project to implement a new JChemPaint based on Java2D and
independent of the widget set used (Swing/AWT/SWT/...).

## CML-roundtripping of the CDK data model
The goal of this project is to ensure that all information the CDK data model can hold can be roundtripped in
[CML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Markup_Language).

##Integrating InChI-NestedVM in Bioclipse
[Rich](http://depth-first.com/) is, besides an excellent blogger, also someone who is not afraid to try new things.
Recently, he experimented with compiling the [InChI library into a Java executable](http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/10/31/jinchi-run-inchi-anywhere-java-runs).
[Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) already is able to generate [InChI](http://iupac.org/inchi/)s,
using the code written by Sam Adams for the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/), but a InChI/NestedVM plugin for Bioclipse
could make a nice show case.

## Writing CDK News articles
On the other hand, you might find that I should focus on getting a new [CDK News](http://cdknews.org/) issue out,
for which we are stilling lacking (finished) contributions.

It's up to you. Deadline in about two weeks; still got some other things to finish :)
