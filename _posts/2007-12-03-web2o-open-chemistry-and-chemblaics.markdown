Chemistry World December issue features a nice item on the future of data in chemistry:
[Surfing Web2O](http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2007/December/SurfingWeb20.asp); Peter
[gave an excerpt](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2007/12/survey-of-open-chemistry.html), and Peter
[commented on it <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2007/12/03/survey-of-open-chemistry-in-chemistry-world/).

The article discusses many of the things that have been happening in the field of chemical data. It
touches [Jean-Claude](http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/)'s work on Open Notebook Science, and then moves to
[Peter](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/)'s Open Data, mentions a number of other blogs and the
[Chemical blogspace](http://cb.openmolecules.net/). Via some video efforts, it ends up with Mitch'
[Chemmunity](http://www.chemmunity.com/), which has the coolest Captcha I have seen so far:

It also cited [Rich](http://depth-first.com/)' blog item on [32 free chemical databases](http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/01/24/thirty-two-free-chemistry-databases),
[Christoph](http://www.steinbeck-molecular.de/steinblog/)'s [NMRShiftDB.org](http://www.nmrshiftdb.org/),
[Project Prospect](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/02/rsc-first-publisher-to-go-semantic.html),
and CML which recently saw [its the 7th research paper](http://cmlexplained.blogspot.com/2007/09/chemical-markup-language-for-spectra.html).

Of course, this is the arena of *chemblaics*, but unfortunately [my blog](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/)
is not cited (though my name mentioned). So, what is wrong with my blog??
