The OD part of [ODOSOS](http://blueobelisk.sourceforge.net/wiki/ODOSOS) is getting more and more attention, and it
seems that [Peter](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/)'s Open Data battle is paying off (see his
[original OpenData article in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Open_Data&oldid=84679322)): an
[open data specific license](http://www.opendatacommons.org/odc-public-domain-dedication-and-licence/) has reached
the beta stage (see this [announcement](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7917)).

The idea behind this licenses seems to come down to:

> **Facts are free**. The Rightsholder takes the position that factual information is not covered by Copyright. This
> Document however covers the Work in jurisdictions that may protect the factual information in the Work by Copyright,
> and to cover any information protected by Copyright that is contained in the Work.

I am looking forward how this license will be picked up by the community. [PubChem](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
may be a good candidate to use this license; to formalize their dump into the public domain. Not just yet, though,
because things might still change. It is said that a wiki will be set up to ask for feedback. Paul has written
[a nice writeup on the history of this license](http://blogs.talis.com/nodalities/2007/12/licensing_open_data_creative_c.php).

I particularly like the quote by Tim O'Reilly from [this blog](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/07/four_big_ideas_about_open_sour.html):

> One day soon, tomorrow's Richard Stallman will wake up and realize that all the software distributed in the world
> is free and open source, but that he still has no control to improve or change the computer tools that he relies
> on every day. They are services backed by collective databases too large (and controlled by their service providers)
> to be easily modified. Even data portability initiatives such as those starting today merely scratch the surface,
> because taking your own data out of the pool may let you move it somewhere else, but much of its value depends on
> its original context, now lost.

In the past I have [argued for the CC-BY license](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/10/open-data-misconception-1-you-do-not.html),
and so does Peter in [this recent comment](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=871) on a post by Deepak on
[educating people about data ownership](http://mndoci.com/blog/2007/12/15/educating-people-about-data-ownership/).
Interestingly, the new license proposes to remove ownership as solution to *free the data* :)
