Our Christmas tree has not been decorated yet, but the presents are there: the *BMC Bioinformatics paper* on
userscripts in life sciences, Bioclipse 1.2.0, a long list of blogs to rate, and a very nice overview from
[Wendy Warr](http://www.warr.com/) on [workflow environments](http://www.qsarworld.com/qsar-workflow1.php),
discussing and comparing different offerings like [Pipeline Pilot](http://www.scitegic.com/products/overview/index.html),
[Taverna](http://taverna.sf.net/), and [KNIME](http://www.knime.org/).

## Userscripts

The paper on userscripts describes how Greasemonkey scripts can be used to combine different information sources
(DOI:[10.1186/1471-2105-8-487](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-8-487)). A trailer:

> **Background** <br />
> The web has seen an explosion of chemistry and biology related resources in the last 15 years: thousands of scientific journals,
> databases, wikis, blogs and resources are available with a wide variety of types of information. There is a huge need to aggregate
> and organise this information. However, the sheer number of resources makes it unrealistic to link them all in a centralised manner.
> Instead, search engines to find information in those resources flourish, and formal languages like Resource Description Framework
> and Web Ontology Language are increasingly used to allow linking of resources. A recent development is the use of userscripts to
> change the appearance of web pages, by on-the-fly modification of the web content. This pens possibilities to aggregate information
> and computational results from different web resources into the web page of one of those resources.

[Peter](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/) et al. have been using this technology for
[CrystalEye](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/crystaleye/) too, but the paper was in a finalizing state when the
[userscript was announced](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=509), unfortunately.

## Bioclipse 1.2.0

The other present is the [Bioclipse 1.2.0](http://bioclipse.blogspot.com/2007/12/bioclipse-120-released.html) release, for which
the QSAR feature is a great new feature addition (see my blog the other day with an overview of blog items detailing
[my participation in that feature](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/12/molecular-qsar-descriptors-in-cdk.html)).
[Ola](http://bioclipse.blogspot.com/) et al. have done a great job with [the plot functionality](http://wiki.bioclipse.net/index.php?title=Charting_plugin),
which is very nice to scatter plot calculated descriptors. This release is likely going to be the last one in the Bioclipse 1
series, except for bug fix releases, so, this release also means I can start contributing to the Bioclipse 2 series. Recent
items in the Bioclipse blog show a bright future, with project based resource handling, better scripting (R, ruby,
JavaScript, BeanShell?).

BTW, we never have presents under the tree; we have [Sinterklaas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinterklaas).
