[Ola](http://bioclipse.blogspot.com/) blogged about something he is working on for Bioclipse2. The next major series
of [Bioclipse](http://bioclipse.net/) releases will use the [RCP](http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform)-based
resource architecture, which allows better integrating with other RCP plugins, such as the
[Subclipse](http://subclipse.tigris.org/) plugin which allows one to browse [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/)
repositories directly in Bioclipse. That is cool! Check out the [screenshot he posted in his blog](http://bioclipse.blogspot.com/2008/01/subversion-in-bioclipse2.html).

Now, this kind of integration is important. Subversion is a tool to collaboratively work on data, which can be
open source (e.g. the Bioclipse source code), open data (e.g. the Blue Obelisk Data Repository), or any other
kind. However, unlike tools like [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/), Bioclipse with Subversion supports
provides you with a *rich* client to process your data. No longer need for putting SMILES into a spreadsheet,
just put the full 3D structure or NMR spectrum in your joint resource set. This is much more suited for
Open Notebook Science, right [Jean-Claude](http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/)? Just put in the raw data as
it came out of the spectrometer, and let Bioclipse deal with data extraction. Oh, did you know that
[Bioclipse has Oscar3 <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2006/06/22/text-mining-for-chemistry-using-oscar3.html)
integrated (which has not been updated to the latest release, though)?

Why bother with Wikis and Google Docs if you have Bioclipse? Why, even, bother with
