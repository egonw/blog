The results for the [Open Lab 2007 are out](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/01/open_lab_2007_the_winning_entr.php).
I participated in this endeavor as judge, and read 75 of the 486 blog items, focusing on the sections *chemistry,
blogging, publishing, politics of science*, and a number of blog items with few reviews when I passed them.

I am happy to see that one of the [chemistry submission I made myself](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/12/my-open-laboratory-2007-submissions.html)
made it into the anthology: the [Depth-First](http://depth-first.com/) item on
[SMILES and Aromaticity: Broken?](http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/11/28/smiles-and-aromaticity-broken).
Congratulations, Rich!
