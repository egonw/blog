The results for the [Open Lab 2007 are out <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/01/open_lab_2007_the_winning_entr.php).
I participated in this endeavor as judge, and read 75 of the 486 blog items, focusing on the sections *chemistry,
blogging, publishing, politics of science*, and a number of blog items with few reviews when I passed them.

I am happy to see that one of the [chemistry submission I made myself <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/12/04/my-open-laboratory-2007-submissions.html)
made it into the anthology: the [Depth-First](http://depth-first.com/) item on
[SMILES and Aromaticity: Broken? <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://doi.org/10.59350/rpn9h-qay37).
Congratulations, Rich!
