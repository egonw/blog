Third in a series summarizing literature citing one of the two CDK articles. See also [#1](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/01/cdk-literature-1.html)
and [#2](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/07/cdk-literature-2.html).

## Reviews
Two reviews have recently appeared which cite the CDK. Ricard Stefani has written a review in Portuguese of the many NMR-based elucidation tools
on computer-aided structure elucidation. The CDK is cited as a general chemoinformatics tool. It also cites
[SENECA](http://sourceforge.net/projects/seneca) which uses CDK's [structure generators](http://cdk.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cdk/trunk/cdk/src/org/openscience/cdk/structgen/). <br />

Quimica Nova, 2007, 30(5):1347-1356, 2007, doi:[10.1590/S0100-40422007000500048](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0100-40422007000500048)*

Dimitris Agrafiotis has written a overview of the current state of chemoinformatics, and the CDK is cited
as tool to calculate molecular descriptors. ([Jörg](http://miningdrugs.blogspot.com/) is co-author, and
[he blogged about this article](http://miningdrugs.blogspot.com/2007/05/recent-advances-in-chemoinformatics.html) too). <br />

## 1H proton coupling prediction
I wrote up a separate blog item on this the article [Janocchio: Jmol and CDK based 1H coupling constant prediction](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/06/janocchio-jmol-and-cdk-based-1h.html)
written by David Evans at Eli Lilly. <br />

## QSAR
Quantitative-structure-activity-relationship (QSAR) modeling projects are finding their way to the CDK too. Dmitry
Konovalov cites the CDK as a free source (as in gratis) for descriptor calculation and touches the problem of reproducibility
of descriptor calculations. Unfortunately, it does not discuss initiatives like the descriptor ontology as is
[discussed in the second CDK article](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2006/06/recent-developments-of-chemistry.html),
or the efforts discussed in the [Blue Obelisk](http://www.blueobelisk.org/) paper (doi:[10.1021/ci050400b](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci050400b)),
such as the Blue Obelisk Data Repository which aim to improve this reproducibility. <br />

## SOAP webservices
Xiao Dong and the rest of the [Indiana team](http://cheminfo.informatics.indiana.edu/) have set up SOAP webservices,
among many wrapping CDK functionality, such as descriptor alculation, 2D similarity and fingerprint calculations, and
2D structure depiction. They also set up a service for [toxTree](http://ambit.acad.bg/toxTree/), which itself uses
the CDK too. <br />
