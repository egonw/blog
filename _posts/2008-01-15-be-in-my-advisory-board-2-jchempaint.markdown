No idea who the 22 persons are who were [willing to join my advisory board](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/11/be-in-my-advisory-board-1-being-good.html),
but they advised me to finish the JChemPaint work [Niels worked on this summer](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/09/swt-view-with-new-jchempaint.html):

Like my current main hobby project ([atom typing in the CDK](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/07/atom-typing-in-cdk.html)), the JChemPaint project will
be performed in my non-working hours mostly. A reasonable ETA is, therefore, end of this summer. Main discussion on will be done on the
[cdk-jchempaint](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cdk-jchempaint) mailing list. Also note that the
[JChemPaint project](http://jchempaint.sf.net/) at SourceForge is deprecated, because the code is now included in the
[CDK project](http://cdk.sf.net/).

Over the next weeks, I will post more questions in the poll of this blog regarding the JChemPaint development. So, watch that space.
