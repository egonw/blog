It has happened. Just a few minutes ago. The [10000th commit](http://cdk.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cdk?view=rev&revision=10000)
to the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) source code repository. Miguel was the lucky(?) one. From our IRC channel #cdk on the
[irc.freenode.net](http://www.freenode.net/) network:

```
[19:55]  cdk: miguelrojasch * r10000 /branches/miguelrojasch/
  reaction/src/org/openscience/cdk/ (2 files in 2 dirs): Removed Flags. 
  They were not used anymore.
```

And a screenshot:

The first source code was actually only added with the [5th commit](http://cdk.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cdk?view=rev&revision=5),
made by [Christoph](http://www.steinbeck-molecular.de/steinblog/), days after our meeting with
Dan (of [Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/) fame) at Notre Dame in September 2000.
