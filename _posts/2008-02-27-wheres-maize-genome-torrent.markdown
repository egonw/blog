[/.](http://slashdot.org/) just posted [a story about the maize genome](http://science.slashdot.org/science/08/02/26/1938210.shtml)
just published, for which the sequences can be downloaded from [this FTP site](http://ftp.maizesequence.org/20080107/). The files
are not that large at all. But it makes me wonder... where are the [.torrent files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_%28protocol%29)
for the sequenced genomes? Here's [Davids catch](http://politigenomics.blogspot.com/2008/02/your-people-call-it-corn.html) on the story.

**Update**: [OpenHelix discusses the matching genome browser](http://www.openhelix.com/blog/?p=165), and indicates that
[hundreds of genomes](http://www.openhelix.com/blog/?p=182) are actively being studied. The
[group where I work](http://appliedbioinformatics.wur.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1) recently
[bought a 454](http://www.genomeweb.com/issues/news/143543-1.html) (reg needed, it seems) and participates in the race.
[Nibbles links the cork event to square peas](http://agro.biodiver.se/2008/02/nibbles-peas/)...
but my biological background prohibits me to see that link...
