[Bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/) just published a paper from Schuemie and Kors (Erasmus University/NL,
[BioSemantics group](http://www.biosemantics.org/)): *Jane: suggesting journals, finding experts* (doi:[10.1093/bioinformatics/btn006](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btn006)):

> [Jane](http://biosemantics.org/jane/index.php) (Journal/Author Name Estimator) is a freely available web-based application that,
> on the basis of a sample text (e.g. the title and abstract of a manuscript), can suggest journals and experts who have published
> similar articles.

Having just gone into a different research field, I appreciate Jane as a useful tool to learn to find my way around in relevant
literature. Based on, for example, the abstract of an article I find interesting, it finds me appropriate journals and authors.
The next screenshot shows the results for the abstract of the [Blue Obelisk](http://www.blueobelisk.org/) paper
(doi:[10.1021/ci050400b](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci050400b)):

The *Show articles* feature as well as the journal annotation are rather useful to get a quick overview of what is being suggested.
The list of authors seems, at first sight, populated by co-authors, and lacks any form of annotation.
[Room for FOAF here](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/10/my-foaf-network-1-foafexplorer.html)? They used PubMed as content
provider, and text mining to *align* articles, but nothing really semantic, despite the group's name. The output does not seem to
provide semantics either.
