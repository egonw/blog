Two things I like blogging: 1. the turn-over of information; 2. the informal nature. There are
[more <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/01/11/why-do-i-blog.html).
The turn-over is optimized by commonly: 1. short blog items; 2. easily allows scanning tons of headlines; 3. often full of links if you want to know the details.

Today, my eye was caught by [Sugammadex Buzz for Organon](http://gaussling.wordpress.com/2008/03/10/sugammadex-buzz-for-organon/) over at
[Lamentations on Chemistry](http://gaussling.wordpress.com/). The reason was [Organon](http://www.organon.nl/), which is just around the corner here.
They had [news](http://www.organon.com/Media/Press_Releases/2008_01_02_Schering_Plough_announces_new_drug_application_for_sugammadex_assigned_priority_review_status_by_U_S_FDA.asp?ComponentID=197129&SourcePageID=8237#1)
about a new drug.

Getting to the second reason, I like the informal nature. Just to make sure I checked the press release, but it was really Gaussling that called
[Sugammadex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugammadex) a *molecular condom*. This is funny for (at least) two reasons. First, it points
(intentionally?) to the birth control drugs of Organon; second, it is right on with how the drug works.
