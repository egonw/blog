In about 26 hours from now, I will be [defending my PhD thesis](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/03/todo-april-2nd-defend-my-phd-work.html).
Follow that link to read the summary; I was thinking if publishing my introduction and discussion (the rest has been published in peer-reviewed
journals) on [Nature Precedings](http://precedings.nature.com/); would that be a good idea? Otherwise, I'll post it in my blog. If you just
happen to want to attend the public defense, it's
