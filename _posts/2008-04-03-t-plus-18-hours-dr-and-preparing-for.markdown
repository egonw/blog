I am doctor now; I shall now be [addressed as](http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/tekst/21#6) *weledelzeergeleerde* Egon;
translating to something like *quite-noble-very-knowledgeable*, hahahaha. I'll put up a few photo's of the ceremony, which
is actually quite formal at the [Radboud University](http://www.ru.nl/), later.

With this blog item, I would to thank everyone who left a message, sent email, etc with good luck messages. Very much
appreciated! I'd also like to thank my supervisors, promotores [Lutgarde Buydens](http://www.cac.science.ru.nl/people/lbuydens/index.html) and
[Peter Murray-Rust](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/) (he mentions the event [here](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=1019)),
and [Ron Wehrens](http://www.cac.science.ru.nl/people/rwehrens/index.html) for their confidence in me and their guidance
on the path towards the post-doc life. I also thank all those who attended my defense; I had a brilliant day, and actually
enjoyed talking to those who took place in my promotion committee and who asked me the not-really-nasty-questions about
my work.

## CDK-Chemometrics in Metabolomics Unconference

For today, I organized a small, informal [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference), oriented around the
[CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/), chemometrics and metabolomics. I'm certain we will be online much of the day, as we typically
do. The meeting will start around 10:00 [CEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Summer_Time), but we'll
attend a seminar by [Marjana Noviƒç](http://www.ki.si/index.php?id=844) at 11:00 CEST. If you happen to be in
[Nijmegen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nijmegen), just drop in on the Analytical Chemistry department.
Otherwise, join the #cdk chat channel in the irc.freenode.net network.

What we'll do?? Hey, it's an unconference; we have no idea yet :)
