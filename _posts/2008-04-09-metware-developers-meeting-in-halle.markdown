Today starts the [MetWare](http://metware.sf.net/) developers meeting, hosted by [Steffen Neumann](http://www.ipb-halle.de/de/forschung/stress-und-entwicklungsbiologie/forschungsgruppen/bioinformatik-massenspektrometrie/),
at the [Leibniz-Institut f√ºr Pflanzenbiochemie](http://www.ipb-halle.de/de/). Steffen's group and the [Applied Bioinformatics](http://www.ab.wur.nl/)
group where I now work, are co-developing an opensource platform for metabolomics data management. Not really a full LIMS system,
but a system to keep track of all the facts about the experiments and samples we would use when analyzing the data in order to
find new chemistry, biomarkers, etc (see [this earlier blog](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/11/metware-metabolomics-database-project.html)
too). Good news is, that BioAssist is developing a support platform for the [NMC](http://www.metabolomicscentre.nl/),
and plans to use MetWare as a main component.

OK, off to catch my train now. See you online (#metware @ irc.freenode.net); the wiki has an
[agenda for the meeting](http://metware.wiki.sourceforge.net/AgendaApril08).
