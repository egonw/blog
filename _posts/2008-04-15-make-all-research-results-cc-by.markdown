While I do not agree in details on the statement made by [Klaus](http://archiv.twoday.net/), I agree with his intentions,
and happy to propagate the [mantra](http://archiv.twoday.net/stories/4851871/), like
[others](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=1038) [did](http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/make-all-research-results-cc-by/)
before me:

> MAKE ALL RESEARCH RESULTS CC-BY

The details I disagree with:

* no need for shouting; we can all perfectly well read it in lower case
* CC-BY is not required; any open data license will do

Now, I know some of you disagree, and I understand the costs for maintaining and curating a database. But, if all
research results would be freely available, these costs can be shared by the community, and we could
*all stand on the shoulders of giants*.
