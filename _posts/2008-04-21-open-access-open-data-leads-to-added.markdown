Two companies recently showed two things:

* open access and open data allow adding value
* adding value is easier by forking

[Rich](http://depth-first.com/)' [MetaMolecular](http://metamolecular.com/) set up [Chempedia](http://depth-first.com/articles/2008/04/17/user-created-compound-monographs-on-chempedia-net-open-sourcing-the-collation-and-indexing-of-chemical-information)
which combines a substructure-searchable chemical [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org/). There is also a
[page to make links](http://chempedia.net/articles/new) to new Wikipedia monographs. Not sure why Rich chose CAS instead of the InChI,
given the recent [controversy on validity of CAS numbers in Wikipedia](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/03/chemical-object-identifier-or-freedom.html)...
realize that this page is for new monograph, of which the CAS number is likely not verified yet, or? On the other hand, the InChI or InChIKey is
[not so abundant in Wikipedia yet](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/11/molecules-in-wikipedia-without-inchis-3.html) (I really must make an updated list).

[ChemSpider](http://www.chemspider.com/) has been using a similar approach to add value to existing resources. The interesting thing in
this case, is that these substructure searchable versions, have an interesting spin off: it allows ChemSpider to build a valuable
DOI-InChI table. So far, I spotted:

* [iucr.chemspider.com](http://iucr.chemspider.com/) ([Antony's story](http://www.chemspider.com/blog/chemspider-rolls-out-website-connected-to-international-union-of-crystallography.html))
* [molbank.chemspider.com](http://molbank.chemspider.com/) ([Antony's story](http://www.chemspider.com/blog/one-more-dedicated-chemspider-website-molbank.html))
* [motd.chemspider.com](https://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/04/motd.chemspider.com) ([Antony's story](http://www.chemspider.com/blog/dedicated-search-pages-for-subsets-of-data.html))

If you wonder how to integrate all data again when things are so distributed, just consider
[userscripts](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/12/christmas-presents.html).
