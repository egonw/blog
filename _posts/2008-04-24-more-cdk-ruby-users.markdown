Via [Rich](http://depth-first.com/)' blog, I was [informed](http://depth-first.com/articles/2008/04/23/campdepict-building-a-simple-smiles-depict-web-application-with-jruby-structure-cdk-and-camping)
about the work by [goesLightly](http://goeslightly.blogspot.com/) on [CampDepict](http://goeslightly.blogspot.com/2008/04/campdepict-jruby-cdk-and-camping.html),
a Ruby-based application which uses the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) for SMILES parsing and 2D diagram generation. With
`cdk-20060714.jar` it's using pretty ancient code, and I have not seen a screenshot.

Anyway, it's nice to see another blogger into the CDK :)
