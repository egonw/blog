Today [Ola](http://bioclipse.blogspot.com/), Jonathan and I have a mini-hack session on getting [JChemPaint](http://jchempaint.sf.net/)
support ported from Bioclipse1 to [Bioclipse2](http://wiki.bioclipse.net/index.php?title=Bioclipse2). And, we made some progress:

I'm sure there is still a lot to do, but this is promising... :)

Oh, and BTW, this is based on the JChemPaint 2.3 / CDK 1.0.2 branch, in case you are interested in those details.
