[Neil](http://blogs.nature.com/thescepticalchymist/author/neil_withers/) [wondered](http://blogs.nature.com/thescepticalchymist/2008/05/jj_day_98_service_with_a_simpl.html)
*"what a [Nature Chemistry](http://www.nature.com/nchem/) paper should look like"*, and asked the following questions.
Below are my answers.

**1. HTML vs PDF: does anyone read the HTML articles? Do you read the PDF on-screen or print it out?** <br />
I typically read the HTML to scan if a paper is interesting for me. But because electronic paper is still too
expensive, I typically make a print of the PDF. I would love to print the HTML instead, if only it was not clouded
with advertisement, link menu's etc. Many websites have a 'Print View' with just the content. Nicely layed out,
but without the menus/etc. NC should adopt this feature (or did I miss that option?).

**2. Big vs little graphics: what does everyone else think about the tiny size of the graphics in ACS html articles?** <br />
I hate the small figures, because they make scanning the HTML more difficult.

**3a. Tagging/’semantic web’: what do you think about the toys on the RSC’s Project Prospect?** <br />
I love tagging and semantic work up. Just browse my blog. I blogged a bit about [Project Prospect](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/search?q=project+prospect)
in the past, and also about using [RDFa for semantic markup of chemistry](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/search?q=RDFa).
I must also mention the nice semantic work by the [Beilstein Journal](http://www.beilstein-journals.org/). Check the HTML
source for all the semantics and the link to the papers RDF version. I discussed some of that work
[earlier](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/04/quality-publishing-endnote-versus.html).

**3b. What kind of things would you like to see tagged/linked to other content in Nature Chemistry?** <br />
I'd really like to see that Nature would pick up social tagging. For example, [Euan/Ian/etc](http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/)
can tell you now tags from blogs/etc, can be used to find relevant other literature. Show
[Connotea](http://www.connotea.org/) tags for NC papers on the NC website. Show related literature based on tag matching.
I also recommend taking advantage of [Postgenomic.com](http://www.postgenomic.com/) and [Chemical blogspace](http://cb.openmolecules.net/)
to complement papers with user comments, or at least link to them (just like linking to [F1000](http://www.f1000biology.com/browse/)).
Regarding domain knowledge: link to whatever open database present, and encourage authors to provide links to public databases,
e.g. by providing InChIs for molecules the describe, PDB identifiers, etc, etc.

**4. 3D molecular structures: do these help your understanding of a paper?** <br />
Absolutely! Henry Rzepa and Christopher Braddock recently showed how one can take advantage of
[Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/) to explain what is going on (doi:[10.1021/np0705918](https://doi.org/10.1021/np0705918)),
but the ACS forgot to make it part of the main text :) A brilliant recent use of Jmol in explaining chemistry, is
[ProtopediA](http://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) that uses *Jmol scripts* to visualize statements
in the textual description in the wiki.

**5. How useful to you are InChIs and SMILES?** <br />
While there is an [OpenSMILES](http://opensmiles.org/) project (part of the [Blue Obelisk movement](http://www.blueobelisk.org/))
to standardize SMILES, I'd go for InChI, and InChIKey if you mind the length of the InChI itself.

**6. Forward linking: do you use it? Would you use an RSS feed that alerted you to new citations of a particular paper.** <br />
I am not sure what forward linking is, so cannot comment on that. However, I would use RSS feeds to alert me of new citations of
a particular paper. Right now, I am relying on [Web-of-Science](http://scientific.thomson.com/products/wos/) to do this for me,
but RSS are an excellent alternative. BTW, I was not aware of such feeds yet, and could use some advertisement!

**7. Would you actually comment on papers if there was a comments box at the end?** <br />
No, I would rather comment in my blog instead. That would place the comments in some perspective. See also my comment
on question 3b.

**8. We really like the [Biochemical Society’s HTML article style](http://www.biochemj.org/bj/ev/381/0329/bj3810329_ev.htm) – do you?** <br />
No, please do not inherit that layout. The use of frames should be discouraged anyway. It seems to be used to easily add
interactivity, but I am positive that Ajax/etc can be used to do all this inline.
