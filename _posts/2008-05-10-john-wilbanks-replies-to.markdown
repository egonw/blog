Not long after I posted my view on things, [John posted his reply](http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/wilbanks/2008/05/10/chemspider-good-intentions-and-the-fog-of-licensing)
on the ChemSpider/OpenData discussion. His comment was merely to illustrate an internal advice to some organization, which got accidentally leaked. Anyway, a must read,
[with two](http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/open-access-data-protocol/)
[good links](http://www.opendatacommons.org/odc-public-domain-dedication-and-licence/) to further reading on open data licensing.

His blog mentions the concept of *public domain*, where data might be dumped, but I always understood that the US public domain concept is different from that of
mainland-EU, German law in particular. This second 'good link' points to a license which formalizes this 'public domain' idea. And reading it, I realize that I
have read it before. But I had completely forgot about it.

A quick reread of these two links, tells me that it indeed is BSD-versus-GPL all over again; with the [Science Commons](http://sciencecommons.org/)
license on the BSD side, and CC-BY-SA at the GPL side. The first surely makes the life easier of aggregators who wish to combine licenses. Can't argue with that.

Then again... what's wrong with a bit of viral character in the license? What's wrong with the statement that 'you may use my data, if I may use your aggregated
data with the same license'? That limits your what you practically can do, but does not limit your freedoms.
