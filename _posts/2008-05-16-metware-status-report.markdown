Following many, many others, I finally got myself a [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/) [account](http://www.slideshare.net/egonw/)
and uploaded a [recent presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/egonw/metware) on [MetWare](http://metware.sf.net/),
our metabolomics data warehouse project. Some spoilers: SQL, RDF/SKOS, JSF.
