Define good. Let me say that up front. Good scientists, that is, if you say successful researchers are good scientists, secure
good funding. Getting good funding requires doing the most relevant research (define relevant). Or, to put it bluntly, being a
successful researcher requires to pimp your research. Doing boring research is nice for you, good for a Nobel prize if it
turns out to have a cool spin off, but doesn't buy you research success.

And, boy, [am I boring or what](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=1130)?
Really, Peter is right... I am boring. He is also right that doing quality control doesn't result in research output. He writes:

There is a huge gap between *should* and *is*. This is partly caused that it is much easier to throw garbage at some piece of
code, than to start an [Ugi reaction](http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2008/05/not-ugi-product.html) on something which is
naturally broken. Take a moment to think about that. *Garbage in, garbage out* is still common in information technology,
but I have never heard of the saying *oil in, oil out*.

**Scientists do not have the ability to recognize garbage (when it comes to data)!** It's statistics, that other boring
stuff I do. Even worse, it's the programmers fault if someone throws garbage at my software and it doesn't return 42.

Unit testing is a poor mans approach to handle garbage. As are diagnostics tools, like
[finding the difference between IChemObjects](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/06/finding-differences-between.html)
(and [#2](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/06/finding-differences-between_03.html)). Unit tests define common
*garbage in* (of course, also *valid input in*, but that does not make it less boring) and tests that the method does
not freak out; that the tested method gives the user some friendly message like
*"Hi there! I'm your friendly computer program. I am sorry to inform you that it's garbage you just passed along. Please clean it up first."*

Anyway, back to my boring research...
