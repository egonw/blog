Steffen reminded me over email that the particular machine only has a 1 dalton accuracy, and that the 150ppm
parameter setting is somewhat inappropriate. As [seen yesterday](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/06/recovering-full-mass-spectra-from-gc-ms.html),
it works fine for larger peaks, but fails for low intensity peaks. So, I reran the `centWave` peak detection with 750, 1000 and 1250 ppm,
and that indeed make [XCMS](http://masspec.scripps.edu/xcms/xcms.php) recover many more metabolites, and, also important, with more
extracted ion chromatograms per metabolite, yielding a more accurate mass spectrum. At the same time, I notice that profiles are not
as clean as before, but that's where the peak fitting with (Modified) Gaussians come into play.

The original 150ppm results:

The 750ppm results:

And for 1000ppm (1250ppm did not further improve):
