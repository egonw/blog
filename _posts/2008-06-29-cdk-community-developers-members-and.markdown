An open source project is as good as its community. [Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/) has a brilliant community, but [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) is not doing
bad either, in general at least; some CDK projects could use some more user feedback, such as [CDK-Taverna](http://www.cdk-taverna.net/)
(site down at the time of writing, but see the [blog](http://cdktaverna.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/cdk-taverna-version-050-release/)).

There are actually quite a few things going on within the CDK Community. There are a few active or less active projects:

* CDK Library *(The main and most well-known component))*
* CDK-Taverna *(just mentioned)*
* [CDK News](http://cdknews.org/) *(Not active enough, please contribute!)*
* [CDK Nightly](http://cheminfo.informatics.indiana.edu/~rguha/code/java/nightly/) *(Rajarshi's nightly build and check service, for trunk/ and [cdk1.0.x/](http://cheminfo.informatics.indiana.edu/~rguha/code/java/nightly-1.0.x/))*
* JChemPaint *(For which a [new version is being developed](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/search?q=jchempaint).)*

(Even withing the CDK Library, several threads are ongoing, but I will report on that at some later stage).

A full [list of projects is found in SVN](http://cdk.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cdk/). A recent new project is *CDK Policy*,
which will attempt to formalize code development such that the library becomes better maintainable. One of the first things
the draft does, is formalize roles withing the community.

## CDK Members and CDK Developers
Basically, anyone with write access to [CDK's SVN](http://cdk.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cdk/) may call himself *CDK Developer*
([57 in total](http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=20024)). So, what if you contributed patches? Then you may
call yourself *CDK Member* (well, as suggested in the draft policy), like anyone else who is subscribed to the *cdk-devel*
mailing list.

This is an important fact. Anyone can subscribe to the list, and directly becomes active CDK Member; He/she gets a voice. The
policy proposes that difference between member and developer to be in the fact that the policy has been accepted by the person.
Therefore, according to the draft policy, *anyone* who **accepts** the policy gets SVN write access, making the CDK not just
Open Source, but an Open Community too. The policy then organizes the maintainability of the software development.

## CDK Users
A CDK User is basically anyone who uses any of the CDK products, but in particular those subscribed to the cdk-user mailing list.

A limited overview of developers, members and users can be found on [this Google map](http://cdk.sourceforge.net/maps/people/):

Just email me (or cdk-user) your latitude/longtitude to have yourself or your research group (URL) linked on this map as user
or developer.
