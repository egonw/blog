This autumn I will end my current post-doc position at [Plant Research International](http://www.pri.wur.nl/) in the
[Applied Bioinformatics](http://www.ab.wur.nl/) group and at [Biometris](http://www.biometris.nl/) (both part of
[Wageningen University](http://www.wur.nl/)) funded by the [Netherlands Metabolomics Center](http://www.metabolomicscentre.nl/)
(lot's of vacancies), where I had a good time, and collaborated in several projects within the NMC with much pleasure.

However, personal circumstances strengthened an older wish of me and my family to seek the adventure of living abroad,
and a vacancy was available in the [group of Prof. Wikberg](http://www.farmbio.uu.se/researchgroup.php?fg=1).
So, we are moving to [Sweden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden). There, I will extend my research on effectively combining
chemoinformatics (sometimes misspelled as *cheminformatics* ;) and chemometrics, as I did in my PhD, which fits well with the
development of [proteochemotrics](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2006/10/are-chemogenomics-and.html) methodology and
[Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) as platform to transform scientific hypotheses into data queries.
