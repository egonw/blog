SourceForge has been playing with system upgrades again, and in an attempt to debug the failing CIA
commits on IRC, I reinstalled the hooks for [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) and [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/),
so that now all hooks seem to fail, including the email hook... Apparently, it is a known bug, e.g. see
[this bug report](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2011306&group_id=1&atid=200001).
I assume SF will fix this soon.

On the bright side, I also noted an updated webpage for [SF uptime/problem tracker](http://sourceforge.net/community/forum/forum.php?id=11&page),
where it is also reported that stats are currently down for upgrade. There also has an
[RSS feed](http://sourceforge.net/community/forum/rss.php?forum=11), which I recommend as a good monitoring
tool for SF site problems.
