[Noel](http://baoilleach.blogspot.com/) had a [40 people vote over chemoinformatics versus cheminformatics](http://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2008/07/chemoinformatics-p0wned-by.html).
What do you think?

I have thrown in two extra options: **chemblaics** (from my blog: *chemblaics (pronounced chem-bla-ics) is the science that uses computers
to address and possibly solve problems in the area of chemistry, biochemistry and related fields. The big difference between chemblaics and
areas as chem(o)?informatics, chemometrics, computational chemistry, etc, is that chemblaics only uses open source software, making
experimental results reproducable and validatable.*) and **bioinformatics** (in case you believe all is life sciences now).
