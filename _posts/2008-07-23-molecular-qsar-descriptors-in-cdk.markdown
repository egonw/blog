Rajarshi has patched trunk last night with his work to address a few practical issues in the molecular descriptor
module of the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) (and I [peer reviewed this work yesterday](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/07/commercial-qsar-modeling-sorry-already.html)).
One major change is that the [IMolecularDescriptor](http://cheminfo.informatics.indiana.edu/~rguha/code/java/nightly/api/org/openscience/cdk/qsar/IMolecularDescriptor.html)
`calculate()` method no longer throws an `Exception`, but returns `Double.NaN` instead. The Exception is stored in the `DescriptorValue` for convenience.
This simplifies the QSAR descriptor calculation considerably, and, importantly, makes it more robust to the input. Though only by propagating errors into
descriptor matrix. *Just make sure your molecular structures have explicit hydrogens and 3D coordinates, and you're fine.*

Anyway, Rajarshi also added a new page to [CDK Nightly](http://cheminfo.informatics.indiana.edu/~rguha/code/java/nightly/)
to [list the available descriptors](http://cheminfo.informatics.indiana.edu/~rguha/code/java/nightly/dnames.html):
