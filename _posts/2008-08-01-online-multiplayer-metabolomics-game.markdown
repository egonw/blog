I was just organizing my [toread](http://delicious.com/egonw/toread)s, when I found this link: [metabolaspel.nl](http://www.metabolaspel.nl/),
an online, multiplayer metabolomics game! It's in Dutch, but I guess anyone will get the idea :) Two teams, each may have two players, fight
each other in sugar-fat conversion, by tuning the metabolism parameters:

The game board should look familiar:

I finally found a worthy follow up for [Civilization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(computer_game)) :)
