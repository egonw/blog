[Google](https://google.com/) has a new service: [Google Insight Search](http://www.google.com/insights/search/), and I was wondering if
it could tell me to use *chemoinformatics or cheminformatics*... No, it can't. In both there is a declining interest (only chemoinformatics
shown):

More interesting is that the interest in chemoinformatics only comes from India:

This tool holds for both flavors too.
