[Deepak](http://mndoci.com/blog) [asked me](http://friendfeed.com/e/bb0667e2-7fbb-f3f5-3b15-696e9af8a492/Is-your-web-service-open-source/) to comment
on his blog post [Is your web service open source?](http://mndoci.com/blog/2008/08/05/is-your-web-service-open-source/). With a slight delay,
I did on [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/e/bb0667e2-7fbb-f3f5-3b15-696e9af8a492/Is-your-web-service-open-source/). I'll copy it here.

The question is about getting return-on-investment: if I developed a new algorithm (or new efficient implementation), how can I make
some money with that, to feed me, continue development, maybe just maintenance. And, how does that work for scientific software, which
can best be opensource? So I replied:

> Deepak, did not have time to read it earlier. I have not worked out monetizing open source chemoinformatics. As a scientist,
> I take the position that any implementation must be open source; that's mere consequence of the scientific requirements for
> peer review and reproducibility. I do understand that further research has to be funded; by making code proprietary, the guy
> doing the further research is the original author. That's not necessarily the right thing for scientific progress.
>
> As a human being, I need feeding. So, I certainly understand making code proprietary, as I have not seen much success in funding ROI
> via support, though I do think this is the way to go, for scientific software that is. Web services are clear services, sort of
> consultancy with human involvement. And consultancy is proven technology. Sell access to your service. Anyone can theoretically set
> it up, but practically... so you basically sell your IT expertise.
>
> A third aspect is user friendly GUIs. Say, ChemOffice, say Bioclipse. These are also scientifically not interesting to develop. Bioclipse,
> being open source, is an interesting example. The core is open, free, any one can contribute, *and* embed that cool new algorithm easily.
> This 'plugin' can be proprietary and sold commercially. No scientific shame, but with a chance for getting some ROI.
>
> Science should be open, and never be a source of capitalism. I am not against capitalism, but I find it rather unethical to say, sure,
> your starving (dying from AIDS, whatever) guy, surely I can help; it will just cost ya. Making money because people like buying big cars,
> Pokemon cards, want their DNA sequenced, sure, no problem. But don't start making money from primary needs. Scientific progress is a
> primary need.
