[FriendFeed](http://www.friendfeed.com/) is a nice aggregation service allowing discussion of items posted from delicious,
blogs, and any other RSS-based feed (e.g. [my feed](http://www.friendfeed.com/egonw)). It also has a *room* concept, where
people can post stuff around a topic, such as a conference such as [Science Blogging 2008 London](http://beta.friendfeed.com/rooms/science-blogging-2008),
or the [CDK](http://www.friendfeed.com/rooms/chemistry-development-kit):

I have associated the RSS feed of the CDK [bug tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?group_id=20024&atid=120024),
the [CDK News ASAP](http://www.steinbeck-molecular.de/cdknews/index.php/CDKNews/issue/view/10),
and will shortly add the [commits messages feed](http://cia.vc/stats/project/cdk/cdk).
