The reason why I have not been able to blog much lately, is that my family and I have been moving to
[Uppsala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala)/Sweden, where I'll start a postdoc in the
[group of Jarl Wikberg](http://www.farmbio.uu.se/researchgroup.php?fg=1) @ [BMC](http://www.bmc.uu.se/) @
[Uppsala University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala_University), where I'll work on chemoinformatics
in drug design, and the use of [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) and [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/)
in particular.

More blogging when I have more frequent internet access again...
