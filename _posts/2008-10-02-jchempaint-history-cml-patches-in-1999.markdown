There was some talk about the history of chemoinformatics toolkits by
[Noel](http://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2008/09/overview-of-cheminformatics-toolkits.html) and
[Andrew](http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2008/09/20/euroqsar.html), which made
me wonder on the exact history of [Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/) and
[JChemPaint](http://sf.net/project/jchempaint). Below is the email
[Christoph](http://www.steinbeck-molecular.de/steinblog/) dug up from his archives:

Dear Egon,

thanks very much for your mail and your offer to write CML-input and
output routines for JChemPaint.
That really sounds great to me and I will give you access to our CVS
tree as soon as we have discussed the details.

Cheers,

Chris

Now, my email must have been triggered by the [announcement of JChemPaint on FreshMeat.net](http://freshmeat.net/projects/jchempaint/),
which is the oldest public record of JChemPaint I have found so far:
