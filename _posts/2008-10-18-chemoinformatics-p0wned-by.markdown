Some time ago [Noel](http://baoilleach.blogspot.com/) [ran a poll](http://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2008/07/chemoinformatics-p0wned-by.html)
on *chemoinformatics* and *cheminformatics*, so I set up a poll too in [part #1 of this series](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/07/chemoinformatics-p0wned-by.html).
The outcome is clear:

The [Obernai meeting](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2006/05/blue-obelisk-in-obernai-at.html) strongly suggested *chemoinformatics*
[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheminformatics)], but the start of the open access [Journal of Cheminformatics](http://jcheminf.com/)
is the killer. I can no longer resist: I'll follow the wish from my [advisory board](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/11/be-in-my-advisory-board-1-being-good.html),
and the general trend around the world ([except India](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/08/mapping-peoples-interest-google-insight.html)).

The journal's editor-in-chief is David Wild, while [Christoph Steinbeck](http://www.steinbeck-molecular.de/steinblog/)
seems to be going to [lead the European branch](http://friendfeed.com/e/44ff87a4-940e-32d7-8745-9459ee2664ef/Christoph-Steinbeck-is-now-Editor-in-Chief-Europe/).
People seem [to like](http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2008/10/journal-of-cheminformatics.html)
[the idea](http://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2008/10/journal-of-cheminformatics-new-open.html). The journal will clearly be in
direct competition for market share with the [JCIM](http://pubs.acs.org/journals/jcisd8/index.html),
[QSAR & Combinatorial Science](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/104557877/home?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0),
and even the open access [Chemistry Central Journal](http://www.journal.chemistrycentral.com/subjects/cheminformaticsandmolecularmodelling).
Interesting to see where this is going...
