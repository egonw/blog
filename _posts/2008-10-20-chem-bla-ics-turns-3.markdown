Five days ago, my chem-bla-ics blog turned 3. Here's the [first post](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2005/10/chem-bla-ics.html).
It defined:

> **chemblaics** *is the application of open source software in cheminformatics, chemometrics, proteochemometrics, etc, making
> experimental results reproducable and validatable.*

Much has changed to the field since that post, for the better of chemical sciences.
