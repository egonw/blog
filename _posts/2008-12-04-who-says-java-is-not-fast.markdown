While performance tests actually show that for even core numerical calculations Java is at par with C in terms of speeds,
and sometimes even hits Fortran-like speeds, people keep think that Java is not fast. I only invite you to test that yourself.

Meanwhile, I would like to take the opportunity to advertise [Noel](http://baoilleach.blogspot.com/)'s
[cinfony](http://code.google.com/p/cinfony/) paper in [CCJ](http://www.journal.chemistrycentral.com/home/)
(doi:[10.1186/1752-153X-2-24](https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-153X-2-24)) which features these speed measurements

I have to say that these numbers surprised me, as the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) is hardly optimized for speed at al...
