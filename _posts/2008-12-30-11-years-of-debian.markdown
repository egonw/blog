11 years ago, a day more or less, I bought an the special issue of [CHIP](http://www.chip.de/) which [shipped Debian 1.3.1](http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/1998/01/msg00359.html).
I think I've tried [SuSe](http://www.opensuse.org/) and [RedHat](http://www.redhat.com/) earlier that year, but this [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) release made me switch away
from proprietary products 98% (taxes I still had to do with Windows98). Right now, I am mostly running [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), which leans heavily on the work of the Debian project.

I celebrated by installing a prerelease of Lenny, Debian's next stable release, but still testing now, in a virtual box with [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/).
Works like a charm, and will allow me in 2009 to finally pick up some packaging work for Debian, and maybe, finally, get Jmol available in Debian main.
