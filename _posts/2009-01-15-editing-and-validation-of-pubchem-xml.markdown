With the general framework set up for [editing and validation of CML documents](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/12/editing-and-validation-of-cml-documents.html),
it was fairly easy to support the [PubChem XML file format schema too](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/specifications/pubchem.xsd).

With the upcoming Bioclipse2 beta (scheduled next Friday), all you need to install on top of the Bioclipse2 core is the new XML feature.
