Richard Kidd wrote in the [ChemistryWorldBlog](http://prospect.rsc.org/blogs/cw/?p=1315) about Henry Rzepa to have published two papers in
[RSC](http://www.rsc.org/) journals where Jmol is part of the main paper, after having used Jmol in extra material in ACS journals before.
The key here is that the [Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/) is part of the official text... when you open the paper in a browser, you immediately
get to see the Jmol live, 3D graphics! Well, so it is said in the blog.

However, when I checked the HTML of the first of the two papers (*A computational investigation of the structure of polythiocyanogen*,
doi:[10.1039/b810147g](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b810147g)). The main HTML **still** links to a supplementary page. Progress, but not
perfect either:
