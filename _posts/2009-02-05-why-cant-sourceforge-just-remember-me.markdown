I do not typically make complaints in my blog, so consider this a request for advice in good practices ;)

My problem is that I have to log in on [SourceForge](http://www.sf.net/) every day, even if I tick the 'Remember me' switch. I do understand that
account log ins do need some time out... but less than a day? One cause of problems seems to be if I connect via a different network, but
[Cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) should not be affected by that? Am I doing something wrong here, or does SourceForge?

Are others having the same problems?
