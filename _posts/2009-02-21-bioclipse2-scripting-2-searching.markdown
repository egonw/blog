This week I have been porting the PubChem plugin for [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) 1.2 to the new manager-based architecture. While still working on the Wizards,
you can run the following JavaScript in Bioclipse2 from SVN and from the next beta (*):

\*) There was some confusion on the *two* beta Bioclipse2 releases so far. Some people expected a release without any bugs left. That release is what we planned to call a
*Release Candidate*. We agree that the first two betas at least turned out to be more alpha than we actually hoped, and we thank everyone who has given these releases a
go. Those who tried several development releases of Bioclipse2 saw a lot of ongoing development, and we are fixing
[any bug reported](http://bugs.bioclipse.net/) on these releases. So, do not hesitate in reporting bugs!
