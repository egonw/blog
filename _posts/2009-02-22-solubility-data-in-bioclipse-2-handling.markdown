[RDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) is swiftly becoming the [lingua franca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca) of life sciences
(see for example [[1](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/10/one-billion-biochemical-rdf-triples.html),[2](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/07/rdf-ing-molecular-space.html)]).
Bioclipse is an excellent platform to visualize results from analysis of the network, both for graph visualization (see
[[3](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/11/solubility-data-in-bioclipse-1.html)]), as well of visualization of domain
specific data types (e.g. sequences, molecules, ...).

Yesterday I uploaded a Bioclipse feature that adds a *rdf* manager to handle RDF content, which includes
[SPARQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) support. The below snippet shows application to the solubility data
