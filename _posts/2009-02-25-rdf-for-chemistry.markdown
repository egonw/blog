[C-SHALS 2009](http://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/cshals2009/io-informatics-news.php) (*Conference on Semantics in Healthcare and Life Sciences*)
has just started, and has coverage in a [blog](http://cshals.blogspot.com/) and in a [FriendFeed room](http://friendfeed.com/rooms/cshals-2009). It
nicely coincides with Rich' blog on [What the Heck is the Semantic Web?](http://depth-first.com/articles/2009/02/25/what-the-heck-is-the-semantic-web),
and the RDF work I have recently done on [rdf.openmolecules.net](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/02/dbpedia-enters-rdfopenmoleculesnet.html)
and [Bioclipse](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/02/solubility-data-in-bioclipse-2-handling.html). (Oh, do I wish I could have attended that
conference.)

Anyway, I was proudly surprised to see [sechemtic](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/search?q=sechemtic) show up in the
[Semantic Web technologies: Introduction and Survey](http://cambridgesemantics.com/2008/09/sem-web-introduction/) tutorial by Lee Feigenbaum of
[Cambridge Semantics](http://cambridgesemantics.com/):

**Use?** Rich was asking what could be done with RDF for chemistry... here is a [nice mashup by Phil Ashworth](http://semantically-challenged.blogspot.com/2008/11/cool-uris-for-molecules.html):
[a Google Map](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/philnjo/phil/chemdemo/chemdemo1.html) showing the locations where certain chemical can be bought:
