[Nature Chemistry](http://www.nature.com/nchem/) just released the first issue with a few free papers,
like *Asymmetric total syntheses of (+)- and (-)-versicolamide B and biosynthetic implications* by Miller et al.
(DOI:[10.1038/nchem.110](https://doi.org/10.1038/nchem.110)).

Now, we've seen the Royal Society of Chemistry's [Project Prospect](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/search?q=project+prospect) <!-- keep link -->
(see [RSC: the first publisher to go semantic! <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/02/01/rsc-first-publisher-to-go-semantic.html))
and ChemSpiders recent [ChemMantis](http://www.chemmantis.com/) system which enriches
the papers with machine readable representations of the molecules discussed in those
papers. The new Nature publication has been in the works for a while, and they
[asked](http://blogs.nature.com/thescepticalchymist/2008/05/jj_day_98_service_with_a_simpl.html)
the community before what a Nature Chemistry paper should like like, and I replied in
[Re: What should a Nature Chemistry paper look like? <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2008/05/08/re-what-should-nature-chemistry-paper.html).

## The verdict

So, have the been listening? Is the HTML they produce semantic? Is it data rich? Or is it
just another hamburger? Well, I am very happy to see some of the suggestions I made picked
up (though I do not fool myself in believing I am the only one that suggested those
features). A tour of good things, and points for improvement.

The first impression is not shocking; it looks like any other interface, with molecules drawn as images in the paper:

![](/assets/images/nchem3.png)

All structures that are numbered and linked (as in *C6-epi-stephacidin A (Compound **13**)*
have a hover-over function to popup a drawing of the structure:

![](/assets/images/nchem4.png)

The popup image is a nice gimmick, but not really sematically useful. The link, however,
is! It points to a separate supplementary page with further information which include
a image of the 2D structure and, following a link, the 3D structure in [Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/).
Moreover, it comes with the machine readable representations:

This is indeed interesting, and a big step forward, though please do note my comments later.
For convenience, all molecules with such supplementary information is available from the
special Chemical Compounds section of the paper:

![](/assets/images/nchem2.png)

Excellent! This really is a step forward towards a data-rich paper! Indeed, I will shortly
write up a [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) plugin for Nature Chemistry, which
will download all molecular structures based on the DOI! Anyway, more on that later...
For this article, that table looks like:

![](/assets/images/nchem1.png)

By now, you likely also noted the links to [PubChem](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and
indeed, upon publication of a paper, all structures are deposited in the public domain:

![](/assets/images/nchem6.png)

At last but not least, each molecule is available in the [Chemical Markup Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Markup_Language)
(with 2D coordinates)! And you know I am a very happy CML user for a long time (see e.g.
Peter's recent blog [Egon Willighagen and CML <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2009/03/13/egon-willighagen-and-cml/)).
BTW, one comment on the CML: the namespace used is the outdated namespace, **not**
the current one (see [There can be only one (namespace)](http://cmlexplained.blogspot.com/2007/06/there-can-be-only-one-namespace.html)).
(But the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) and Bioclipse will read it anyway.)

## Details matter

So, while the first impression was not shocking, it was a bit deceptive. *Nature Chemistry*
really changes publishing of chemistry. But I have bad news too. They need to improve the
HTML they produce.

But before pointing out some missed chances, let me reply *inter alia* to Peter's recent
work on the Open Source plugin for including semantic chemistry in MS-Word documents
(see [How can we publish semantic chemical documents? <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i](https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2009/03/16/how-can-we-publish-semantic-chemical-documents/)):
Nature Chemistry seems to have done a great job with existing tools. Nevertheless, I fully
back up Peters comment that while the plugin is useless without Word, the results produced
with the plugin are extremely Open Standard, and enormously reusable! Indeed, while the
Word file format is only formally an true Open Standard, the file format is plain XML, and
extracting content bearing the CML namespace is trivial.

Which reminds me, if someone from the Nature Chemistry team is reading this, please point
me to a blog what tools actually *are* involved in publishing a Nature Chemistry paper!
I think we all like to know.

Now, the [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) has room for improvement. First of all,
a look at the metadata defined for the web page of the article shows a *description*
and *keywords* about the journal, not the article, and the same goes for the web pages for
the molecules:

![](/assets/images/nchem7.png)

Additionally, the compound details web page has no special markup for the machine readable
information:

![](/assets/images/nchem8.png)

Or, if it does, it's still mixed with markup for visual pleasing output:

![](/assets/images/nchem9.png)

Still, the HTML is clean enough to have some regular expressions extract a good deal of
information, and there is also still the PubChem deposition.

## Beyond connection tables

Like many other chemistry journals, Nature Chemistry does not consider properties of
the molecule interesting, and NMR spectra are hidden in the Supplementary Information.
This paper in particular, disregards a lot of machine readable facts by putting all
experimental section bits in a PDF document. So, the next challenge for Nature Chemistry
will be to get the authors of papers contribute the original spectra (JCAMP-DX, CMLSpect,
etc) in the supplementary information section. Better, have the raw data or even the NMR
peak-atom annotations deposited in public repositories such (see 
[Open NMR data: raw curves and annotated peak lists](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/03/open-nmr-data-raw-curves-and-annotated.html)).

All in all, I am rather positive about the first Nature Chemistry issue, and like to
thank the editors and paper authors for there efforts on improving publishing chemistry!
