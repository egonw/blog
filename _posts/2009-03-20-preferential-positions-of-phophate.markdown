A long time ago ('96 or so?), as a student with the no longer existing CAOS/CAMM (Google shows some traces, like
[this chapter describing the centre](http://iospress.metapress.com/content/rd7e7efkrllad1tn/)), I did a short internship
with Hilbert Bruijn-Slot (I hope I remember his name correctly), where has asked me to look at data in the CSD, and in
particular the prefered position of phosphate counter ions. It was a fun research, and almost made it into a paper, if we
were not just beating by a few months by a group of Russians who just published the same.

Today, [Neil asked me](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/03/nature-chemistry-improves-publishing.html?showComment=1237542960000#c7670910429973706274)
to look at another Nature Chemistry paper (DOI:[10.1038/nchem.100](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nchem.100)), and in particular
[its Chemical Compounds table](http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v1/n1/compound/nchem.100_ci.html). I could not directly
spot the thing not in the table I discussed, but did notice the phosphate salts in the table. Not uncommonly, the counter ions are not near the phosphate in this diagram and I wondered how they did this in 3D.

Well, bringing back good memories to that internship I mentioned, [the 3D model](http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v1/n1/compound/nchem.100_comp5_3d.html)
shown by [Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/) actually does show the salt, and with the two sodiums near the phosphate;
even better, they sit at very recognisable positions :)
