I have submitted today the abstract of my talk at the [GDCh-Wissenschaftsforum Chemie 2009](http://www.gdch.de/vas/tagungen/tg/5580/wissprog/symp.htm)
[in Frankfurt in August](http://www.dopplr.com/trip/egonw/523957) as part of the Open Notebook Science/Open Drug Discovery session:

> "Open Knowledge: Reproducibility in Cheminformatics with Open Data,
> Open Source and Open Standards"
>
> Abstract:
> The Open paradigms in science have been met with strong criticism.
> Nevertheless, support and use of Open models among scientists is
> growing. While the Open model is certainly only one approach to doing
> science, it has a few aspects that make propagation of knowledge more
> transparent. Indeed, Open Data, Open Source and Open Standards
> (ODOSOS) make it easier to reproduce of knowledge and promote peer
> review. Various ODOSOS projects will be introduced which improve
> reproducibility in cheminformatics, the underlying science of
> exchanging chemical knowledge. Recent contributions of the Chemistry
> Development Kit, Bioclipse, chemical ontologies and others will be
> discussed that add to the repertoire of Open Cheminformatics, and how
> these contribute to Open Knowledge.

The exact details I do not know yet, and likely not before the weekend before the meeting :) But this blog gives a good impression of what you can expect.
