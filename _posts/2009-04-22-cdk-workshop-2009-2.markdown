The second CDK Workshop day started off with application presentations, which are well covered by Chris' blog posts:

* [John van Drie’s talk on CDK in Virtual Drug Discovery](http://www.steinbeck-molecular.de/steinblog/index.php/2009/04/21/john-van-dries-talk-on-cdk-in-virtual-drug-discovery/),
* [Asad Rahman on Small molecules and reaction mechanism - Rewiring the enzyme space](http://www.steinbeck-molecular.de/steinblog/index.php/2009/04/21/asad-rahman-on-small-molecules-and-reaction-mechanism-rewiring-the-enzyme-space/), and
* [Oliver Karch about Molwind - Using CDK to Visualize Molecule Spaces in a Geospatial Context](http://www.steinbeck-molecular.de/steinblog/index.php/2009/04/21/oliver-karch-about-molwind-using-cdk-to-visualize-molecule-spaces-in-a-geospatial-context/).

You can also find [coverage on Twitter](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23cdkws2009) by
[Jim](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/downing/) and [Nico](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/adams/).

The afternoon we had a more development-oriented [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). It was a bit exciting for me and
[Chris](http://www.steinbeck-molecular.de/steinblog/) as previous such sessions at CDK workshops involved 5 to 10 participants instead some
20+ now, but things nicely self-organized into 5 sessions:
