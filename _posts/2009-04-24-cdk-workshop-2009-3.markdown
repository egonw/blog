Last of my writing on the [CDK Workshop](http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/cdk/index.php?title=CDK_Workshop_2009). It was great fun meeting all the CDK developers
and users, and thanx to everyone for all that they contributed, in particular during the unconference part! Yesterday, I had a travel day, and slept 12 hours in one
go last nite. This leaves me with a long list of follow emails, CDK patches and many other things to catch up with. But it was more than worth it.

In the next months, we will say which conversations during the workshop will lead to fruitful collaborations and new CDK contributions. I already have a patch around
for `@cdk.threadsafe` and `@cdk.threadnonsafe` in reply to the [Threading](http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/cdk/index.php?title=Threading_group)
session at the unconference, which I'll ask Rajarshi to review.
