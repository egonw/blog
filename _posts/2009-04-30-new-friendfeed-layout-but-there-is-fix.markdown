[FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/) is the missing link between social [bookmarking|news|...] and [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)
(#cdk on [irc.freenode.net](http://www.freenode.net/)); I quite like it. Anyway, as of today, they have a new layout, and that I do not like. No more
icons for feed types, and big avatar photo's. Really, I *know* what my fellow blogger look like (even met many of them
[in London last year](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/08/science-blogging-2008-london-was-cool.html)). The rest of
the layout is a bit too colourful for my taste.

Fortunately, [Neil](http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/) posted [three very useful](http://friendfeed.com/neilfws/3c83a2e5/my-beta-ff-greasemonkey-suite-is-complete)
[GreaseMonkey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey) script to clean stuff (and since I use those to link science databases and resources anyway, see
[Christmas Presents](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/12/christmas-presents.html) and
DOI:[10.1186/1471-2105-8-487](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-8-487)): [FriendFeed Service Icons](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/46187#),
[Cleaner FriendFeed](http://userstyles.org/styles/16747), and [Remove avatars from Friendfeed beta](http://userstyles.org/styles/16763).
The last may require the script target websites to no longer point to the beta server, but the real thing. However, by the time you read this,
the script may already be updated.

After installing these, my FriendFeed page looks better again:
