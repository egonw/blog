[My thesis](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/03/todo-april-2nd-defend-my-phd-work.html) was *released* slightly over a year ago in print form. The electronic form
has not yet, which has social and legal barriers. Like many before me, I made the *mistake* to publish in journals that require me to reassign copyright. Combine that
with the custom to publish papers in your thesis as is, which means reduction of work for the manuscript committee, as they can know which chapters have undergone
peer-review in the form they are present in the thesis too. (The layout is different, as I integrated them into the thesis design.)

So, my thesis has [six chapters](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/03/todo-april-2nd-defend-my-phd-work.html) which I cannot redistribute. I am still happy having
published in the [Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling](http://pubs.acs.org/journal/jcisd8) (formerly *JCICS*), and still review papers for that journal; it
still is the main forum in cheminformatics, but recently [challenged](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/03/journal-of-cheminformatics-i-hope.html).

I have come to the conclusion that copyright transfer will not be my author choice in the future, and the ACS AuthorChoice still seems to require copyright transfer,
if I do not misunderstand the legal talk.

So, if you like a copy of those six chapters, send me an email requesting the a print copy of my thesis from my defense (I still have a few around). (Alternatively,
donate to my project to make these chapters AuthorChoice, but the ACS charges quite some money, and Google Adsense is not compensating for that quite yet.)
