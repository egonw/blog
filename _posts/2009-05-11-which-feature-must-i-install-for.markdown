Dear lazyweb!

I have been trying to figure out which Eclipse 3.4 feature I must install from the update site to get the *org.eclipse.zest* plugin
in my environment.

I installed the [Zest](http://www.eclipse.org/gef/zest/) feature (which I am going to use to
[visualize an RDF network](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2008/11/solubility-data-in-bioclipse-1.html)), but my workspace still
complained that I did not have the plugin.

Maybe I should rerun *Set Target Platform* for our product, but I and others in the Bioclipse development community have been
wondering how we can know what feature to install via the Software Updates... to get a particular plugin on your machine?

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Kind regards,

Egon
