[Michel](http://dumontierlab.com/) visits [our group](http://www.farmbio.uu.se/researchgroup.php?fg=1) this week and gave a
very exciting talk yesterday on the role of ontologies in drug discover. This being ongoing research in our group too, the talk was
well received by the audience (which was not too large, because after mid-summer, Uppsala has holiday). First the first time, I
microblogged a talk on [my twitter account](http://twitter.com/egonwillighagen) (using the
[#dumontieratuppsala](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=dumontieratuppsala) tag). I have not got a XSLT ready to convert the
relevant items into a nice HTML snippet for embedding in this blog, but will try to do that later. Meanwhile, I also made a
few bookmarks here and there, which are available from [Delicious](http://delicious.com/egonw/%23dumontieratupssala).

The rest of the day, we talked about various ontology, bio- and cheminformatics related stuff. We looked at
[SADI](http://sadiframework.org/), [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) (and my RDF extension, see
[these JavaScripts](http://delicious.com/tag/bioclipse+gist+manager:rdf)),
[Bio2RDF](http://www.bio2rdf.org/), [rdf.openmolecules.net](http://rdf.openmolecules.net/?InChI=1/CH4/h1H4),
and [Virtuoso](http://www.openlinksw.com/dataspace/dav/wiki/Main/VOSRDF).
