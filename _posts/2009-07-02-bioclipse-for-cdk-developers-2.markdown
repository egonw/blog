I [reported earlier](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/02/bioclipse-for-cdk-developers-1.html) how [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/)
allows you to use a script to perceive atom types for the content of the JChemPaint RCP editor. This functionality is now available in the
outline, and indicates directly if Bioclipse (and the underlying [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/)) understands the chemistry you are drawing. In a
future Bioclipse release, these *problems* will be visualized more prominently, likely using the Errors/Problems Views available from Eclipse, or otherwise.
