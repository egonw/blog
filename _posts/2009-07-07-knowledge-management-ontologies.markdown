Chemistry has a bit of background in ontologies, and [ChemAxiom](http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/adams/?p=245) is certainly not the
first (though I think it is rather promising...). Three years ago I gave a presentation at the CUBIC (now existing as
[LinkedIn Alumni Group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2071414)), which is not so extensive, but does have a few interesting
citations on the use of ontologies in chemistry on slide 16:
