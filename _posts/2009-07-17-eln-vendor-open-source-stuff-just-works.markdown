Simon Coles is CTO of [Amphora Research Systems](http://www.amphora-research.com/) (a company I do not know) and in the
business of [Electronic Lab Notebooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_lab_notebook). I know nothing about their
products but would like to propagate the [statements he just made on Open Source](http://elnblog.com/2009/07/use-of-open-source-in-commercial-eln-products/)
in reply to a [question on LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/groupAnswers?viewQuestionAndAnswers=&discussionID=5153766&gid=1148517)
(btw, [my LinkedIn account](http://www.linkedin.com/in/egonw)):

> We use a lot of Open Source components in our products, and I know we’re not alone.

He also gives why they do so, quoting from the full arguments in his blog:

* *The Open Source stuff just works better*
* *Support is better*
* *Licensing issues go away*
* *It is dramatically cheaper for our customers to deploy*
* *We have much more latitude in deployment options*

I am not sure if this involves open source cheminformatics, but asked about that... the whole article is worth reading.
