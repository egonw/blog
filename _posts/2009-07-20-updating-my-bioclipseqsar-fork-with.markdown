[GitHub](http://github.com/) makes forking cheap, and I have a [fork](http://github.com/egonw/bioclipse.qsar/tree/master) of the
[bioclipse.qsar](http://github.com/olas/bioclipse.qsar/tree/master) repository (see
[Bioclipse moving to GitHub: CIA hooks enabled](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/07/bioclipse-moving-to-github-cia-hooks.html)),
so that I can easily share my patches with Ola for review. Ola can review them and apply them back into his main version.

I was wondering how I could bring my fork synchronized with Ola's version again, and found the answer in this guide on GitHub.
It turns out all I have to do is, though this is locally:

```shell
$ git remote add olas git://github.com/olas/bioclipse.qsar.git
$ git pull olas master
```

This gets me into the following state:

This [gitk](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitk.html) output show that my local *master* branch is
identical to Ola's master *branch* on GitHub, while both are three commits ahead of my current *master* branch at GitHub.

Right after this, I updated my fork at GitHub with a simple `git push`, resulting in this gitk output:
