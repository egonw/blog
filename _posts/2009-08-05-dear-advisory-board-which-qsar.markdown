> Dear Advisory Board,
>
> Ola Spjuth has recently been working on a extensive QSAR environment in [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/), and molecular descriptors are
> provided using remote services but also using the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/). The CDK has a relatively large collection of QSAR descriptors,
> but certainly not the full list discussed in the [Handbook of Molecular Descriptor](http://www.moleculardescriptors.eu/books/handbook.htm).

> I'm sure everyone would appreciate a few more descriptors, and I am wondering which ones you would assign priority to. So:
