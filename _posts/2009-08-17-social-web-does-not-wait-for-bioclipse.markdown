[Google Wave](https://wave.google.com/) is going to change the web. It's the end of Google Docs, and likely many other services. It's
going to be Open Source and being a Wave Provider will not be restricted to Google. This will be enough to make this a success. If
you haven't watched the full video demo yet, please have a look yourself:

<object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/v_UyVmITiYQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;">
  <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always">
  <embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/v_UyVmITiYQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340" wmode="opaque">
</object>

I left some thoughts and notes on FriendFeed, but they got lost.
