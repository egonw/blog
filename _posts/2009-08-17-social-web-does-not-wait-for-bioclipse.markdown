[Google Wave](https://wave.google.com/) is going to change the web. It's the end of Google Docs, and likely many other services. It's
going to be Open Source and being a Wave Provider will not be restricted to Google. This will be enough to make this a success. If
you haven't watched the full video demo yet, please have a look yourself:

</object>

I left some thoughts and notes on FriendFeed:
