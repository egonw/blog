Journals in chemistry are pretty well fixed. *JACS*, *Angewandte Chemie* are clear leaders. *Nature* and *Science* if you have something that
will attract many scientists. For the rest many smaller journals exist more dedicated at particular research areas.

[PLoS ONE](http://www.plosone.org/) is a new journal that changes the way science is published: it publishes anything that is scientifically
sound and does not make any judgement on impact and lets the community deal with that. [Cameron Neylon](http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/)
recently had him taped to discuss [article-level metrics used at PLoS ONE](http://vimeo.com/5696434) (see also
[this](http://shirleywho.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/the-evolution-of-scientific-impact/)).

And, PONE (as they affectionately call it) seems to be steadily growing to, at least, become a BIG publisher. Clearly, not dedicating yourself to a small discipline helps. And the IT we have had around for the past 10 years make this large scale publishing possible. The impact of a paper becomes clear through those article level metrics.

Finding interesting papers, however, may be a bit more difficult. There are dedicated RSS feeds listed at the front page:

And I recently subscribed to [the Chemistry feed](http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?startPage=0&field=&pageSize=10&catName=Chemistry)
([RSS](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/plosone/Chemistry)).

One of the sources taken into account for the article-level metrics is Postgenomic.com, and you may be aware that
[Chemical blogspace](http://cb.openmolecules.net/) is using the same software. However, us ~60 active have not been paying attention
this PONE feed. Well, there have appeared only 84 papers yet in this subsection:

... but only one has been cited in Chemical blogspace, which is a bit disappointing:

So, what are your reasons you do not read this journal yet?

I have spotted one paper which I will soon read and review: *How Large Is the Metabolome? A Critical Analysis of Data Exchange Practices in Chemistry*
(doi:[10.1371/journal.pone.0005440](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005440)).
