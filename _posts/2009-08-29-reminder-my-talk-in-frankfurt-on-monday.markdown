Quick and short reminder about my [Open Knowledge: Reproducibility in Cheminformatics with Open Data, Open Source and Open Standards](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/04/open-knowledge-reproducibility-in.html)
talk on Monday. The session is great anyway, with other talks from [Cameron](http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/), [John](http://chembl.blogspot.com/) and
someone from Berlin on a Open Access HTS system (which reminds me to talk about the *Open Access* and that the term is tainted).

I still have a free program, other than I want to see [Google Wave](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/08/social-web-does-not-wait-for-bioclipse.html)
in action (and while I have receive my invitation, I have not received a login account yet). There is a potentially interesting talk about
*Second Generation Small Molecule Therapeutics* by 15:00. But no plans otherwise for the afternoon and/or evening.

If you like to talk about [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/), [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) and/or the [Blue Obelisk movement](http://blueobelisk.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main_Page).
Or about my talk on Open Data, Open Standards and Open Source (ODOSOS) in chemoinformatics.

If you happen to be around the Frankfurt Westend campus. In building 4, I think, the Hörsaalzentrum, where the conference is. Please
let me know if you like to meet up. I hope to be online :), but no promise on that... should work at a Uni location, not?
Let's see... This is how to ping me, and don't worry about redundancy.
