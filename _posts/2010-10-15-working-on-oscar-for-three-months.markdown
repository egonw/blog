As Peter [announced <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2010/10/11/update-and-real-excitement/) in his blog, and I tweeted earlier, I have started as postdoctoral
research associate in [Peter's group](http://www-pmr.ch.cam.ac.uk/wiki/Main_Page) at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/),
to work the next three months on [Oscar](https://oscar3-chem.sf.net), a chemical text mining tool. My tasks will focus on programmatical
plumbing instead of method development, and I am aiming at integration with [CDK-Taverna](http://cdktaverna.wordpress.com/installing-cdk-taverna/)
(see doi:[10.1186/1471-2105-11-159](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-159), and which is currently being ported to
[Taverna 2.2](http://www.taverna.org.uk/) by Andreas). [Sam](http://sea36.blogspot.com/) and Lezan having been working on the refactoring
as well, and will help me out with the gory details of the current code.

The source code of Oscar4 is available from [this BitBucket project](https://bitbucket.org/wwmm/oscar4), and you can monitor the code
state on [this Hudson page](https://hudson.ch.cam.ac.uk/job/oscar4/). The project I will be working on, is in collaboration with the
[ChEBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/) project, and today we met up with various people in the group, and set out some really interesting
use cases.
