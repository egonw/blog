[Linus' law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus'_Law):

<ul><i>given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.</i></ul>

[Rich](http://depth-first.com/) of [MetaMolecular](http://metamolecular.com/) works on Open Source and closed source cheminformatics
solutions. [ChemWriter](http://chemwriter.com/) is one product he is working on which uses JavaScript and [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG)
(two Open Standards), and recently asked feedback on the new version. Test users found a problem on Google's
[Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) browser, and Rich then [did something <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://doi.org/10.59350/x4j7q-m6h98)
that is only possible in an Open Source environment: he downloaded the buggy product (Chrome), started looking for the cause, found it, and
filed a [detailed bug report](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=65238). Just think that would have happened
if this problem was in MS Internet Explorer...

Well done!
