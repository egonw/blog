Later this year the ninth [International Conference on Chemical Structures](http://www.int-conf-chem-structures.org/home.html)
(ICSS) conference will be held in the Netherlands. I had the pleasure of joining this meeting, I think, eight years ago, when
I was doing my PhD in Nijmegen. Mind you, I did not *attend* the conference; I helped with the organization ;) That was a good
deal, particularly because I got to meet many cheminformaticians while working behind the registration desk ;)

Actually, my gravatar still reflects that meeting, as it is a picture taken on the boat trip on the [Markermeer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markermeer).
That was one great boat trip: I steered a *driemaster*, and helped out on the boat on ropes outside the deck, meters above the water.
Cheminformatics can be so nice! The photo was taken during a calmer part of that boat trip :)

Back to the ICCS. It's one of the bigger cheminformatics meetings, and likely the best after the yearly
[GCC meetings](http://www.gdch.de/gcc2010/). Mind you, the term cheminformatics reflects more the methods than the domains.
Indeed, the meeting's [Call for Papers](http://www.int-conf-chem-structures.org/call-for-papers.html) lists many topics
highly relevant to [my position here at KI](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2011/01/karolinska-institutet.html),
including chemogenomics, (Q)SAR, literature mining, "integration of medical and biological information" (including
semantic web technologies), and in-silico analysis of toxicology, drug safety, and adverse events.

Depending on the schedule this year, I may actually submit an abstract based on what we will do in the next year, and see
what happens. The CfP deadline is 31 January.
