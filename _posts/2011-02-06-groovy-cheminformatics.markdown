**Update**: the [fourth edition <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2012/01/15/groovy-cheminformatics-4th-edition.html) is out.

Some project are never finished. Neither is this one, but it is never too late to change how things work, so, taking advantage of
publishing-on-demand, here I introduce the release-soon, release-often equivalent of cheminformatics books, my
[Groovy Cheminformatics with the Chemistry Development Kit](http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/groovy-cheminformatics-with-the-chemistry-development-kit/14745007)
book:

With a serious discount for just being the first edition (1.3.8-0), but still counting at 72 pages with 75 code examples, this edition
marks a personal milestone (and probably not much more than that). There remains much to do, but I promised a release by tomorrow, so
here it is. Next releases will contain more code examples, more functionality descriptions, and more literature reviewing where such
code is used in science. The plan is to make new editions with each new [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/) release, as well as new editions
when I added a new chapter, section, or just paragraph. But, there will not be a Nightly build service anytime soon.

The current table of content is as follows:

Now, the book content is ***not*** open content. However, it contains nothing that is not available in other means. It's just the
compilation that makes this book interesting, as well as that I put effort in ensuring the code examples remain working.
For that, I ask a minor financial contribution.
