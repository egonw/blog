I'm having a really bad month, as you can see from the number of posts. Too much to do, too little time. One of the things
I have been doing in the past weeks is update the RDF for [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/), now up to
version&nbsp;09. The [SPARQL end point <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20121123055403/http://rdf.farmbio.uu.se/chembl/sparql) has not been updated yet (which is
still at ChEBML 04), but you can now download the triples for self-hosting here. Like the database itself, the RDF is
available under the [CC-SA-BY license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), requiring attribution to both
the ChEMBL team as well as our efforts to create the RDF (see this
[README](https://github.com/egonw/chembl.rdf/blob/master/README.markdown)).
