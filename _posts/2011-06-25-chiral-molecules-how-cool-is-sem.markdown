I just found my student thesis in Organic Chemistry from my [Nijmegen](http://www.ru.nl/) education. It's in Dutch, but I'll
explore if I can upload this to [Radboud University's DSpace](http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/). But I could not resist sharing
this nice scanning electron microscope picture :) Look at those amphiphiles show a nice chiral ribbon!

This disk also has quite a few raw spectra (as TIFF images). I'll try figure out what to do with those. Uploading as Open Data
to [ChemSpider](http://chemspider.com/) is tempting, but I want to make sure I can easily have people download the collection
too (read: programmatically).
