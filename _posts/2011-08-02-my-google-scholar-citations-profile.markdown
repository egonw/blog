[Web of Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Science) is my de facto standard for citation statistics (I need these for
[VR](http://vr.se/) grant applications), and defines the lower limit of citations (it is pretty clean, but I do have to ping them now
and then to fix something). The public front-end of it is [Researcher ID](http://www.researcherid.com/rid/C-6136-2008). There is an
[Microsoft initiative](http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Author/2893110/egon-l-willighagen), which looks clean but doesn't work
on Linux for the nicer things, but the coverage of journals is pretty bad in my field, giving a biased (downwards)
[H-index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index). And [CiteULike](http://www.citeulike.org/user/egonw) and
[Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/egon-willighagen/) focus more on your publications than on citations (though the former
has [great CiTO support](http://opencitations.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/use-of-cito-in-citeulike/)!).

Then [Google Scholar Citations](http://googlescholar.blogspot.com/2011/07/google-scholar-citations.html) (GSC) shows up. While it
does not look as pretty as competing products, it compensates that with a wide coverage of literature (for example, it supports the
[JChemInf](http://jcheminf.com/), which Web-of-Science currently does not; and I happen to publish a lot in that journal recently),
books, and reports, while keeping false positives fairly low. Thus, it provides an upper limit of my citations statistics, but one
I am pretty happy confident about. And my H-index is quite comparable anyway. This is what
[my profile](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u8SjMZ0AAAAJ) looks like:

So, these statistics have two purposes to me: 1. grant applications, and 2. I like to know what people based theirs on my research. (Well,
OK, 3. it helps me understand why I work so hard on too many things.)

Now the question is, will GSC take off. Will it replace [ORCID](http://orcid.org/)? Will they join ORCID? Will GSC get a good API?
Who will write the first [userscript](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/487) to make the GUI fancier? Will GSC support CiTO?
Will GSC start using microformats or RDFa? What mashups can we expect between bibliographic databases? Will new entries automatically
be posted to Google+? Will it have a button to autocreate a blog post when a paper gets cited 100, 500, or a 1000 times? Will GSC
support [#altmetrics](http://friendfeed.com/search?q=%23altmetrics)?
