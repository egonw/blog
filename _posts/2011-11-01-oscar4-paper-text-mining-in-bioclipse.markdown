The [Oscar4 paper](http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/41) (CC-BY, just like the screenshots of the paper below) was out already some days now, but the formatting has finished:

I spotted a rogue `http://` in the code example b) in [Appendix B](http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/41#IDAE2JBD):

I'll see what I can do about that, but the API might evolve a bit anyway.

That leaves me to mention that [Bioclipse has an Oscar extension](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2011/09/almost-year-ago-i-started-position-with.html)
([Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) has a lot of functionality nowadays, in fact),
and that I [blogged several times on Oscar4](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2010/12/text-mining-chemistry-from-dutch-or.html)
when I was working with the other authors on the refactoring last year.
