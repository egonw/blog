Now that I have wrote out [the goals](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.nl/2013/10/programming-in-life-sciences-1-six-day.html),
what they students will practically do, and how to [get started](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.nl/2013/10/programming-in-life-sciences-2-accounts.html)
with the [Open PHACTS](http://openphacts.org/) platform, I will list how we will assess the students:

1. a presentation on the second day, outlining the project and work plan,
2. working source code at the end of the cour
se,
3. a final presentation, showing the results and conclusions.

Primarily, they will be judged on their acquired programming skills. Working code is the minimum; but code quality will be taken
into account too. I will show them how blogging works as a pre-print server for presentations. I hope it will also learn them
what role this has in scientific communication.
