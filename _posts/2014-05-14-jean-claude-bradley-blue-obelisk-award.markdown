There are nowadays a lot of people talking about Open, about open access, open data, open source. In fact, some discussion on Twitter resulted
in the realization that it is highly unlikely that any scholar has not taken advantage of Open in some way in their research in the last few
years. However, this is mostly due to people whom actually do, not by those who talk about it or use it.

One of the few people in chemistry who did both promoting Open and doing Open was [Jean-Claude Bradley](http://usefulchem.blogspot.nl/).
Yesterday, I heard the sad news that he passed away. This is a great loss to many of us and certainly to the open chemistry community.
Jean-Claude received the [Blue Obelisk award](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/blueobelisk/index.php?title=Blue_Obelisk_Awards) for
his [Open Notebook Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Notebook_Science) work back in 2007 (I handed him the obelisk at the ACS
meeting in Chicago; thanx to [Chris](http://www.steinbeck-molecular.de/steinblog/index.php/2014/05/14/in-memory-of-open-science-pioneer-jean-claude-bradley/)
for taking the picture, and digging it up!) and he contributed much to the community, among which his melting point and
[solubility data](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.nl/2008/11/solubility-data-in-bioclipse-1.html) for organic compounds.

Jean-Claude and I did some work together, including a book chapter, which I liked being a trained organic chemist myself (well, just a
[6 month minor](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.nl/2011/06/chiral-molecules-how-cool-is-sem.html) during my M.Sc. on supramolecular chemistry).
I was really pleased that he had accepted to become part of the [eNanoMapper](http://enanomapper.net/) scientific advisory board, and
I was very much looking forward to working with him again on the journal side of dissemination of nanosafety research, in his role as
editor-in-chief of [Chemistry Central Journal](http://journal.chemistrycentral.com/).

Few people leave a big impression on me, but he was certainly one of them.

there is still a [lot to do](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.nl/2013/09/urgent-open-science-needs-for-drug.html) in Open chemistry.
