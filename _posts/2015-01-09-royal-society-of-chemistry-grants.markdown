The [Royal Society of Chemistry](http://www.rsc.org/) and [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/)
just released an interesting [press release](https://blog.wikimedia.org.uk/2015/01/royal-society-of-chemistry-grants-journals-access-to-wikipedia-editors/comment-page-1/):

> "The Royal Society of Chemistry has announced that it is donating 100 “RSC Gold” accounts –
> the complete portfolio of their journals and databases – to be used by Wikipedia editors who
> write about chemistry. The partnership is part of a wider collaboration between the Society’s
> members and staff, Wikimedia UK and the Wikimedia community. The collaboration is working to
> improve the coverage of chemistry-related topics on Wikipedia and its sister projects."

This leaves me with a lot of questions. I asked these in a comment awaiting moderation:

> Can you elaborate on the conditions? Is it limited to wikipedia.org or does it extend to
> other Wikimedia projects, like Wikidata? Does the agreement allow manual lookup of information
> only, or does it allow text mining on the literature as well as on the database? How should
> I put this in perspective with the UK law that allows text mining, and, in particular, can
> UK Wikipedia editors use text mining anyway, or is that restricted? Is there an overview
> of the details of what is allowed and not allowed, or a list of restrictions otherwise?

Details on how to apply to access can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RSC_Gold).
