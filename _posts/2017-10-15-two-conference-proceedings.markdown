It takes effort to move scholarly publishing forward. And the traditional publishers have not all shown to
be good at that: we're still basically stuck with machine-broken channels like PDFs and ReadCubes. They seem
to all love text mining, but only if they can do it themselves.

Fortunately, there are plenty of people who do like to make a difference and like to innovate. I find this
important, because if we do not do it, who will. Two people who make an effort are two researchers who
recently published their work as conference proceedings: [Tobias Kuhn](http://www.tkuhn.org/) and
[Finn Nielsen](https://github.com/fnielsen). And I am happy to have been able to contribute to both efforts.

## Nanopublications

Tobias works on [nanopublications](http://nanopub.org/wordpress/) which innovates how we make knowledge machine
readable. And I have stressed how important this is in my blog for years. Nanopublications describe how
knowledge is captures, makes it FAIR, but importantly, it links the knowledge to the research that led to the
knowledge. His [recent conference proceedings](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_26)
details how nanopublications can be used to establish incremental
knowledge. That is, given two sets of nanopubblications, it determines which have been removed, added, and
changed. The paper continues outlining how that can be used to reduce, for example, download sizes and how
it can help establish an efficient change history.

## Scholia

And Finn developed [Scholia](https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/), an interface not unlike Web-of-Science. But
then based on [Wikidata](http://wikidata.org/) and therefore fully on CCZero data. And, with a community
actively adding the full history of scholarly literature and the citations between papers, courtesy to the
[Initiative for Open Citations](https://i4oc.org/). This is opening up a lot of possibilities: from keeping
track of articles citing your work, to get alerts of articles publishing new data on your favorite gene or
metabolite.
