There was a lot of Open Science news this week. The [announcement](https://www.blog.google/products/search/making-it-easier-discover-datasets/)
of the [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) was one of them:

Of course, I first tried searching for "[RDF chemistry](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch/search?query=RDF%20chemistry&docid=hiQ14TdWzjx%2FQ37gAAAAAA%3D%3D)"
which shows some of my data sets (and a lot more):

It picks up data from many sources, such as [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) in this image. That means it also works
(well, sort of, as [Noel O'Boyle noticed](https://twitter.com/baoilleach/status/1037986030266318848)) for
supplementary information from the [Journal of Cheminformatics](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/).

It picks up metadata in several ways, among which [schemas.org](http://schemas.org/). So, next week we'll see if
we can get [eNanoMapper](http://enanomapper.net/) extended to spit compatible JSON-LD for its data sets, called "bundles".

## Integrated with Google Scholar?

While the URL for the search engine does not suggest the service is more than a 20% project, we can
hope it will stay around like Google Scholar has been. But I do hope they will further integrate it
with Scholar. For example, in the above figure, it did pick up that I am the author of that data set
(well, repurposed from an effort of [Rich Apodaca](https://twitter.com/rapodaca)), it did not figure
out that I am also on Scholar.

So, these data sets do not show up in your Google Scholar profile yet, but they ***must***. Time will
tell where this data search engine is going. There are many interesting features, and given the amount
of online attention, they won't stop development just yet, and I expect to discover more and better
features in the next months. Give it a spin!
