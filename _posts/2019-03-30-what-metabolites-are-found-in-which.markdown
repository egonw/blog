In December I reported about Groovy [code to create nanopublications <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2018/12/27/creating-nanopublications-with-groovy.html).
This has been running for some time now, extracting nanopubs that assert that some
metabolite is found in some species. I send the resulting nanopubs to
[Tobias Kuhn <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q42027946), to populate his
*Growing Resource of Provenance-Centric Scientific Linked Data*
(doi:[10.1109/eScience.2018.00024](https://doi.org/10.1109/eScience.2018.00024),
[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06532.pdf)).

Each data set comes with [an index pointing to the individual nanopubs](http://np.inn.ac/RA6KPZ2qS8joGDOA9EvfcNHeNsg6nI2_T1YePsYMjL9io),
and that looks like this:

I wonder what options I have to to archive the full set up nanopublications on
Figshare or Zenodo, and see that DOI show up here...
