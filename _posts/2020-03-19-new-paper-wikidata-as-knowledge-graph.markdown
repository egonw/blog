As a reader of my blog, you know I have been doing quite some research [where Wikidata has some role](https://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/search?q=wikidata).
I am preparing a paper on the work I have done around chemicals in Wikidata, based on what I
[presented at the ICCS with a poster](https://figshare.com/articles/Wikidata_and_Scholia_as_a_hub_linking_chemical_knowledge/6356027).
So, I was delighted when [Andra](https://twitter.com/andrawaag) and [Andrew](https://twitter.com/andrewsu) asked me to contribute
to a paper outline the importance of Wikidata to the life sciences. The paper was published in [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/),
which I'm excited about to, as they do a significant amount of publishing innovation.

I'll keep this post brief, as I have plenty of work to do, among which is SARS-CoV-2 data in Wikidata. Join this project,
after you read the paper: *Wikidata as a knowledge graph for the life sciences* (doi:[10.7554/eLife.52614](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52614),
or in Scholia):

* [Wikidata:WikiProject COVID-19](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_COVID-19).

I'll write up some more queries for this eBook now: [Wikidata Queries around the SARS-CoV-2 virus and pandemic](https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/).
