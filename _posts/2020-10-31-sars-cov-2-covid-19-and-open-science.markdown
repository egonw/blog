<span style="font-size: smaller; text-wrap: break-word;"><a href="https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4846">WP4846</a> that I started on March 16. It will see a massive overhaul in the next weeks.</span></div>
Voices are [getting stronger](https://www.robertschuwer.nl/?p=3116) over [how important Open Science](https://twitter.com/RetractionWatch/status/1321512267855339520)
is. Insiders have known the advantages for decades. We also know the issues in the transition, but the transition has been steady. Contributing to Open Science is
simple: there are plenty of project where you can contribute without jeopardizing your own research (funding or prestige). Myself, my small contributions have been
done without funding too. But I needed to do something. I have been mostly [self-quarantined since March 6](https://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2020/03/sars-cov-2-stuck-at-home-flu-and.html),
with only very few exception. And I'm so done with it. Like so many other people. It won't stop me wearing masks when I go shopping (etc).

Reflecting on the past eight months, particularly the last two months have been tough. It's easier to sit at home and in the garden when it is warm outside, light. But for another 7 weeks or so, they days will only get darker. The past two months were also so busy with grant reporting that I did not get around to much else, even with an uncommon long stretch of long working weeks, with about 8 weeks of 70-80 hrs of active work in that period. In fact, the past two weeks, with most of the deadlines past, I had a physical reset, and was happy if I made 40 hrs a week. 

So, where is my COVID-19 work now, where is it going?

## Molecular Pathways

First, what did we reach? First, leveraging from the Open Science community I am involved in, I stared collaborating. With old friends and making new
friends. I was delighted to see I was not the only one. In fact, Somewhere in May/June, I had to give up following all Open Science around COVID-19,
because there was too much.

For example, I was not the only one wanting to describe our slowly developing molecular knowledge of the
[SARS-CoV-2](https://scholia.toolforge.org/topic/Q82069695) virus. While my pathway focused on specifically the confirmed processes for SARS-CoV-2,
my colleague Freddie digitized a recent review about other corona viruses. Check out her work:
[WP4863](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4863), [WP4864](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4864),
[WP4877](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4877), [WP4880](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4880),
and [WP4912](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4912). In fact, In fact, so much was done by so many people in such a short time, that the
[WikiPathways COVID-19 Portal](http://covid.wikipathways.org/) was set up.

## Interoperability with Wikidata

<div style="float: right; width: 300px"><img src="/assets/images/Screenshot_20201031_104646.png" /></div>
Because I see an [essential role](https://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2020/03/new-paper-wikidata-as-knowledge-graph.html) for
[Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/) in Open Science, and because regular databases did not provide identifiers for the molecular building blocks,
we created them in Wikidata. This was essential, because I wanted to use [Scholia](https://scholia.toolforge.org/) (see screenshot on the
right) to track the research output (something that by now has become quite a challenge; btw, checkout
[Lauren's tutorial on this](https://laurendupuis.github.io/Scholia_tutorial/)). This too was
[still in March](https://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2020/03/talking-sars-cov-2-with-big-data.html). However, because Scholia itself is a
general tool, I needed shortlists of all SARS-CoV-2 genes, all proteins, etc. So, I created [this book](https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/).
It's autogenerated and auto-updated by taking advantage of SPARQL queries against Wikidata. And I am so excited the book has been translated in
[Japanese](https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/ja/), [Portugues](https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/pt/), and
[Spanish](https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/es/). The i18n work is thanks to the
[virtual BioHackathon in April](https://github.com/virtual-biohackathons/covid-19-bh20), where Yayamamo bootstrapped the framework
to localize the content.

Also during that BioHackathon, we started a collaboration with [Complex Portal](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/home)'s
Birgit, because the next step was to have identifiers for (bio)molecular complexes. This work is still ongoing, but using a
workaround we developed for [WikiPathways](https://wikipathways.org/) (because complexes in GPML currently cannot have
identifiers), we can now link out to Complex Portal, as visible in this screenshot:

<a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/complex/CPX-373">CPX-373</a> identifier in Complex Portal.</div><br /></center>

Joining the Wikidata effort is simple. Just visit [Wikidata:WikiProject_COVID-19](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_COVID-19)
and find your thing of interest. Because the past two months have been so crowded, I still did not get around to explore the
[kg-covid-19 project](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-covid-19), but sounds very interesting too!

## Computer-assisted data curation

For some years now, I have been working on computer-assisted data curation of WikiPathways, but also Wikidata (for chemical compounds).
Once your biological knowledge is machine readable, you can have learn machines to recognize common mistakes. Some are basically
simple checks, like missing information. But it gets exciting if we take advantage of linked data, and we can have machines check
consistency between two or more resources. The better out annotation, the more powerful this computer-assisted data curation becomes.
Chris has been urging me to publish this, but I haven't gotten around to this yet.

As part of my COVID-19 work, I have started making [curation reports for specific WikiPathways](https://github.com/wikipathways/SARS-CoV-2-WikiPathways/tree/master/reports).
To enable this, I worked out how to reuse the testing without JUnit, allowing the tests to be used as a library. That allows creating the reports, but in the future
will also allow use directly in PathVisio. A second improvement to the testing stack is that tests are now more easily annotated.
That allows specifying tests only to be run for a certain WikiPathways portal.

But a lot remains to be done. I think at this moment I only migrated, perhaps, some 5% of all tests. So, this is very much on my "what is next?" list.

## What is next?

There is a lot I need, want, and should do. here are some ideas. Maybe you wan to beat me to it. Really, I don't mind being scooped,
when it comes to public health. Here goes:

1. file SARS-CoV-2 book [translation update requests](https://github.com/egonw/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atranslations) for some recent updates
2. update the SARS-CoV-2 book with a list of important SNPs
3. add BioSchemase to the SARS-CoV-2 book for individual proteins, genes, etc
4. update WP4846 with recent literature
5. have another 'main subject' annotation round for SARS-CoV-2 proteins
6. migrate more pathways tests from JUnit into the testing library
7. write a new test to detect preprints in pathway literature lists and check for journal article versions
8. finish the Dutch translation of the SARS-CoV-2 book
9. write a tool to recognize WikiPathways complexes with matches in Complex Portal
10. write a tool to generate markdown for any WikiPathways with curation suggestions based on content in other resources
11. develop a few HTML+JavaScript pages to summarize WikiPathways COVID-19 Portal content
