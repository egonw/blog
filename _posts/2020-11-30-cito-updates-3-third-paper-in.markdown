Last week [the third paper](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-020-00474-z) got published
in the [Citation Typing Ontology Collection](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/cito) and this weekend
I finished adding the citation annotations to Wikidata.

While the number of papers in the [Journal of Cheminformatics](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/) is only
[slowly growing](http://127.0.0.1:8100/venue/Q6294930/cito), the number of journals receiving annotated citations
is growing faster. And there are 70 now:

The [Scholia patch](https://github.com/fnielsen/scholia/pull/1289) needed for this updated table is not online yet.
