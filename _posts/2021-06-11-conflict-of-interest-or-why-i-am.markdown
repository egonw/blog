In this open letter, I will explain why I intend to step down as Editor-in-Chief of the *[Journal of Cheminformatics](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/)*,
which also happens to be a Springer Nature journal. It took me two years to come to this decision, and it cannot be claimed that I did not carefully
evaluate the various aspects of it. However, I have now come to the conclusion that the opportunity it gives me to implement my ambition to shape open
science chemistry now conflicts with the interests of Springer Nature. I will here outline some of the things I have taken into consideration.

## A personal note and thank you
I will remain Editor-in-Chief until the end of the year. The journal is doing awesome things and if I get the chance, I will likely continue help the
journal become even more open science.

Thanks also to **Chris** and **David** for starting the journal. It has been an honor and pleasure to follow their steps. Also a huge thanks to
**Rajarshi** with whom we have been Editor-in-Chief for close to five years now. It has been a great pleasure to work so actively on Open Science.
Also thanks to **Nina** and **Barbara** to joined me and Rajarshi as associate editor and have helped shape the journal. It is comforting I leave
the journal with an excellent team. Also, a big thanks to **Samuel** and **Matthew** who have been helping us getting the Open Science things done
and the the current and past [Editorial Board](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board) members for important discussions in the
telcons. Finally, a thank you to all the **authors and reviewers** who have all been working so hard to make the journal a success!
