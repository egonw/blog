Part of the scientific program of the ICCS 2022.

Now that most speakers confirmed their talk by registering for the conference, it was time to upload the preliminary
[scientific program <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20220429210627/https://iccs-nl.org/general-information/scientific-program/) of the
[International Conference on Chemical Structures](https://iccs-nl.org/)
([#2022ICCS <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://hashtags-hub.toolforge.org/2022ICCS)).

The conference will have 5 sessions:

* Analysis of Large Chemical Data Sets,
* Structure-Activity and Structure-Property Prediction,
* Dealing with Biological Complexity,
* Structure-Based Approaches, and
* Cheminformatics Approaches.

I am also a bit disappointed that the nanoinformatics community did not submit much work. I guess that like the gaps with the
nanomedicine community, the link with the cheminformatics community is also a bit weak.

I am also delighted that two [BiGCaT](http://www.bigcat.unimaas.nl/) researchers (Denise Slenter and Ammar Ammar) will
present their research in Noordwijkerhout. I am looking forward to seeing you all in June. You can
[register here](https://iccs-nl.org/general-information/registration/).
Keep in mind the number of places is limited and the registration is filling up quickly.
