Sometimes I think back about how [Scholia](https://scholia.toolforge.org/) started, and then I think I remember a
Twitter discussion. Twitter was a social platform that was unable to fight hate speech. I left it last year in favor
of [Mastodon](https://scholar.social/@egonw).

Anyway, I did some digging today and found [this thread](https://twitter.com/fnielsen/status/785008295505489920) from
October 8-9 2016. A few days earlier, Finn has created a profile based on data in Wikidata on his homepage,
[which I was very happy about](https://twitter.com/egonwillighagen/status/783190125882777600). You can see how
[Dario suggests](https://twitter.com/ReaderMeter/status/784810921029881856) to put that webpage up on Toolforge.
For completeness, this is [the first commit](https://github.com/WDscholia/scholia/commit/484104fdf60e4d8384b9816500f2826dbfe064ce.patch),
October 9.

This chat was after [@fnielsen](https://fosstodon.org/@fnielsen)'s [blog post](https://finnaarupnielsen.wordpress.com/2016/09/30/the-wikidata-scholarly-profile-page/)
about the idea of the needed open infrastructure and a possible [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/) solution from
September 2016. Finally, it was also only half a year before Scholia got
[mentioned in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21800).

BTW, at the time there still was a focus on bibliographic information. We learned since that the Wikidata platform
cannot technically meet the needs, at least not at this moment. Instead, the focus is now much more about the
literature that supports the knowledge in Wikidata and Wikipedia and make that as interoperable as possible.
