This is my last post on blogger.com. At least, that is the plan. It has been a great 18 years. I like to thank the owners of
blogger.com and Google later for providing this service. I am continuing the chem-bla-ics on a new domain:
[https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/)

I, like so many others, struggle with choosing open infrastructure versus the freebie model. Of course, we know these things come
and go. Google Reader, FriendFeed, Twitter/X (see doi:[10.1038/d41586-023-02554-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02554-0)).
My new blog is still using the freebie model: I am hosting it on GitHub. But following the advice from a fellow cheminformatician,
I now front this with a owned domain name.

See you at `linkedchemistry.info`!
