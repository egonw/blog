Two weeks ago the write up of a week-long scientific discussions around artificial intelligence for natural product drug discovery
in Leiden at the [Lorentz Center](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/) got published
(doi:[10.1038/s41573-023-00774-7](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41573-023-00774-7)).

Sadly, the meetings was still during the (partial) lockdown, and I think my contribution could have been
more extensive. But I am happy I got to pitch the idea of using Wikidata in this area too, taking advantage
of the work done by the LOTUS (doi:[10.7554/eLife.70780](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.70780)) team earlier.

And this is key to me: you cannot do statistics, chemometrics, machine learning, or artificial
intelligence without good quality linked data. Happy reading!
