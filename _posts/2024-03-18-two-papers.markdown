My research is about the interaction of (machine) representation and the impact on the success of
data analysis (matchine learning, chemometrics, AI, etc). See the posts
[about](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2010/08/09/molecular-chemometrics-principles-1.html)
[molecular](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2010/08/12/molecular-chemometrics-principles-2-be.html)
[chemometrics](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2010/08/14/molecular-chemometrics-principles-3.html).
This got me into [FAIR](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/tag/fair): making data interoperable
and being able to (really) reuse data is the starting point of doing research.

So, when I get the chance to see something where I worked on to make more FAIR actually being used,
I love to push the boundaries of FAIR a bit extra. The study of representation of molecules and molecular
systems is not quite a popular science, but I find it important. Two new papers got recently published
to which I contributed from this perspective.

The first paper by Anna Niarakis <i>et al.</i> is about using the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 knowledge base we
have collected of the past 4 years (doi:[10.3389/fimmu.2023.1282859](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1282859)).
For me, this started with a WikiPathways with early knowledge about the virus proteins. I think
in this and earlier papers, we improved our open science and bioinformatics and are actually
more ready for a next pandemic, which inevitably will come.

The second paper by Alfaro Serrano <i>et al.</i> is about how access to data remains key to many
things, and this, obviously, includes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
(doi:[10.1039/D3SU00148B](https://doi.org/10.1039/D3SU00148B)). When it comes down
to the face/off of FAIR versus Open, I think Open has more impact, hands-down.

About the latter, I recently wrote up ten simple actions you can take to make your
nanosafety research output more FAIR (doi:[10.5281/zenodo.10533126](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10533126)).
