Last week I attended the [Open Science Retreat](https://openscienceretreat.eu/) ([#osr24nl](https://hashtags-hub.toolforge.org/osr24nl))
in a quite and relaxing region in North-Holland. The meeting was how I like all meetings to be (and I count myself lucky many of my meetings
are like this): open, welcoming, constructive, diverse, and intellectually challenging. Not all scientific meetings are like this
and it is easy to end up going to obligatory meetings where the discussions are of a different level. Therefore, great thanks to
the organizers, but also to all participants, that showed not just to have a hearth for open science (getting pretty common),
but also a drive to advocate for open science. Finally, I like to thank the people that joined me in creating nanopublications for
CiTO annotations (will blog about that later), and [to Sadik and Marija](https://twitter.com/marija_purgar/status/1773745895508451573)
with whom we worked on exploring using Wikibase for capturing knowledge about research waste in ecology (more about that later too).
