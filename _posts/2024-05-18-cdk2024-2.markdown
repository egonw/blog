Publishing grant proposal is still not very common. The proposal published in Research Ideas and Outcomes)
(doi:[10.3897/rio.10.e124884](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.10.e124884)) for the
[NWO Open Science grant for the CDK](/2024/04/07/cdk2024.html) is, however, not the first and hopefully not the last.
Interestingly, it is already cited in (the German) Wikipedia. It is used [there](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry_Development_Kit)
to support a statement which tools use the Chemistry Development Kit.
