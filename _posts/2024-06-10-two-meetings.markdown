Noting that in the coming week I am not attending the [ELIXIR All Hands in Uppsala](https://elixir-europe.org/events/elixir-all-hands-2024).
Having lived in (and around) Uppsala for more than three years, I am disappointed and with the first stories from colleagues coming
in even more. But it has been a way too busy year, I have much to finish up, and I need to take care of myself too. I am not 32 anymore.

But in the past two weeks I did attend two workshops. The first was a [workshop](https://www.aanmelder.nl/intoxicom2024firstworkshop) by the
[ELIXIR Toxicology Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/toxicology), which was held in Utrecht/NL. The programme was around
FAIR and included two really nice hands-on sessions where we developed drafts for [FAIR Cookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/)
recipes (see also doi:[10.1038/s41597-023-02166-3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02166-3)) and for
[FAIR Implementation Profiles](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/fair-implementation-profile/)
(doi:[10.1007/978-3-030-65847-2_13](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-65847-2_13)). We will write up a
[BioHackrXiv](https://biohackrxiv.org/discover) report.

The second workshop was last week, the [FAIR4ChemNL workshop](https://tdcc.nl/evenementen/fair4chemnl-workshop/), which was also held
in Utrecht/NL. The topic was FAIR in chemistry, and we discussed various aspects. There was a significant participant group from the
German NFDI4Cat project ("Cat" is short for (chemical) catalysis), which recently published a nice analysis of several ontologies
(doi:[10.1186/s13321-024-00807-2](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-024-00807-2)). And there was also a lot of mention of RDF and SPARQL.

I think it is time for a new special issue around semantic web technologies.
