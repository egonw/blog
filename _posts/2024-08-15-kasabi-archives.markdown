[Kasabi](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128214915) was an innovative RDF publishing platform from around 2011.
[Shortlived](https://web.archive.org/web/20130907095112/http://blog.kasabi.com/about/), and maybe just too early.
I published to open datasets there. One was ChEMBL-RDF (see these [posts](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/tag/chembl)).
The second was a small data sets called [ChemPedia](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2011/07/06/chempedia-rdf-2-kasabi.html),
a open science effort to crowdsource chemical names. This is still very much needed, and possibly Wikidata could fill that gap,
but it would first need to be able to handle all labels as statements itself.

Anyway, just before they shutdown because of, I understood, lack of commercial interest, they
[archived all data](https://archive.org/details/kasabi), including the ChemPedia datasets. I was happy to be reminded about that,
because I am not sure I had archived that data.
