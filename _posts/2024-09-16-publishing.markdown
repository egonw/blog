If you read my blog, it should not surprise you that I have long experimented with technologies
to improve knowledge dissemination, for example [in HTML](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2006/12/10/including-smiles-cml-and-inchi-in.html). And I have [blogged about publishing](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/tag/publishing)
from an author and researcher, and editor perspective, for many years (see [this longer list
on my old blog](https://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/search?q=publishing)).
Also, in the [Journal of Cheminformatics](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/)
we pushed for innovation, including [ORCID and GitHub adoption](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-019-0365-4) and [Citation Typing Ontology adoption](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-020-00448-1).

All of these depend on the publisher to support these efforts. But the big publishers are not good
at this (see also doi:[10.5281/zenodo.4926031]()https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4926031)
and/or prefer to make 20-30% profit first.

This opens room for innovative publishers. We have [F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/) pushing open peer review,
and [PenSoft](https://pensoft.net/) pushing a new editor,
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) bringing collaborative online editing of LaTeX,
[Qeios] experimenting with a [wider range of output types](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2023/07/02/qeios-open-dissemination-platform-for.html),
and the  [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) (JOSS) pioneering
a more open platform for the whole editing process.

And, of course, we have [Diamond Open Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_open_access)
publishers that do not get enough visibility, like [SciPost](https://scipost.org/)
and [Beilstein](https://www.beilstein-journals.org/) for natural sciences and
JOSS for open source.

## Open Journal Systems

And there is the [Open Journal Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs/) (OJS), another
editor manager, one that has been around for some time now. We use OJS for the
[CDK News newsletter](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/tag/cdknews).
Big news this week was that [OJS has been selected](https://pkp.sfu.ca/2024/09/12/ojs-infrastructure-for-open-research-europe/)
as infrastructure to underping the [Open Research Europe](https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/) publishing platform,
something running on F1000Research, [bought up up Taylor&Francis in 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1000_(publisher)).

I need to catch up with where the OJS is technically. Do they support Markdown
submissions? Do they export [JATS](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/)? Do they support CiTO annotations? But this needs
editors and journals to expect these things. Unfortunately, many journals have
a limited expectation of digitial knowledge dissemination, and it's still
PDF galore.

## Better Publishing

This brings me to the following: should the Dutch universities continue to fund
the publisher business, stakeholder profit, or should we invest in open infrastructure
to benefit our own core business: research and education. I think you understand
what my position is on this. The current big deals we have with the big
publishers are not actually really in our benefit and with the upcoming defunding
we have to use every euro carefully. And then I prefer to fund a young researcher
instead of publisher stakeholders.

I hope you are willing the read the following petition to the Dutch negotiators
to very carefully consider what their priorities are and who they represent.
You can sign anonymously (if you fear backslash) and you can just read the details
behind this well-written petition: there are many references at the bottom to
support the statements I make here, and more.

But I really, really hope you wish a better future for knowledge dissemination.
Just think of your next Reviewer 2, that you pay the publisher to have Reviewer 2
scold at you, or the time spent on reference formatting, just because the publisher
prefers profit over usability.
