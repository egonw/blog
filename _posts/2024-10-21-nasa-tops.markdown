It was on my radar for some time already, but did not get around to finishing it. But I completed all
five modules of the [NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) Open Science 101](https://openscience101.org/)
(doi:[10.5281/zenodo.10161527](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10161527)).
This Open Science 101 consists of several modules, starting with *The Ethos of Open Science*, via
*Open Tools and Resources*, *Open Data*, and *Open Code*, to *Open Results*.

Now, since I have been practising aspects of science for almost 25 years, I have to admit I was nervous
doing this. That probably explains why it took me so long to do it. Just going through the material will
probably take 4-8 hours, but there was a lot to reflect on. They also link to many additional resources
and cite a good bunch of scientific research.

I also like to stress that I like the material very, very much. It is very well designed, covers a lot
of aspects, and finds a great balance between depth and coverage. Sure, I had some comments here and
there, but it higjhlights very well what open science really is, what not, and how the open science
community is working on reaching the goals, which things work well, and which things need more work.

The material itself is [open and available from GitHub](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science).
