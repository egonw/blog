I have [not posted a lot](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/tag/vhp4safety) about our [Virtual Human Platform for Safety Assessment](https://vhp4safety.nl/)
(VHP4Safety) project yet. Actually, more generally I do not post frequently about the funded projects. This is likely that few of them are Open Science
by contract and often they have some formal process in place to approve output. That makes open notebook science-style posting about these projects
hard. One is restricted to previously cleared material.

One such material is the new project paper about VHP4Safety, *The Virtual Human Platform for Safety Assessment (VHP4Safety) project: Next generation chemical
safety assessment based on human data* (doi:[10.14573/altex.2407211](https://doi.org/10.14573/altex.2407211)). It is a fun project to work in,
ambitious, and in a vibrant community making steps in open science. That means that a lot of what we is core science, but the science comes
from many different disciplines, and it is as much natural sciences as it is humanities.

So, we somewhere during the project we started organizing hackathons. Some of us had plenty of experience with that already, but these
are hackathons from fields where this has not been as common, perhaps. But is has been fun, e.g. see
[this write up of the third hackathon](https://www.sciencrew.com/c/9347/a/335221636?title=Advancing_AI_in_Toxicology_Insights_from_the_Third_VHP4Safety_H).

There is a lot more I should be writing about VHP4Safety, and I will try, but for now I will limit it to these pointers:

* the main VHP4Safety website: [https://vhp4safety.nl/](https://vhp4safety.nl/)
* our documentation platform: [https://docs.vhp4safety.nl/](https://docs.vhp4safety.nl/)
* our catalogue of cloud services: [https://cloud.vhp4safety.nl/](https://cloud.vhp4safety.nl/)
* our common language: [https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/](https://glossary.vhp4safety.nl/)

And we try to register our solutions as widely as possible, e.g. with national and ELIXIR indices:

* our [Taxila.nl section](https://taxila.nl/content_providers/vhp4safety)
* out [ELIXIR TeSS section](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/content_providers/vhp4safety)
