If you are into openscience chemistry or chemistry blogging, then you probably heard of
[Rich Apodaca](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3855-9427)'s [Depth-First blog](https://depth-first.com/).
Rich [started blogging in 2006](https://doi.org/10.59350/xyp0f-9dt42) but this is not
how I discovered his work originally. I know that we at least already had contact in 2005,
because that is when he wrote about an integration between his Octet library and the Chemistry Development Kit
in the [CDK News](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cdk/files/CDK%20News/) (volume 2, issue 2),
*CDKTools: The CDK-Octet Bridge*. In 2006 he [reviewed our use of the Open Journal System for CDK News](https://doi.org/10.59350/esgte-mv539).

But I did find we have been blogging about our work a lot. [Searching for Rich](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Achem-bla-ics.blogspot.com+rich)
gives false positives, but plenty of discussions of his work. At the same time, [my name shows up multiple times](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:depth-first.com+egon)
in Depth-First too. Looking back at our shared history, we find, for example, Rich has blogged a lot about using the
[Chemistry Development Kit in Ruby](https://doi.org/10.59350/50ebs-4zq55).

Rich [blogged about a lot of cheminformatics innovation](https://depth-first.com/articles/). For example,
in 2006 [he was working on multi-atom bonding](https://doi.org/10.59350/pz3p6-fv247),
such as in ferrocene, something that is even today not routinely used in cheminformatics. I replied
to that in [this post](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2006/12/30/modern-chemistry-in-cdk-beyond-two.html).
Another thing he explored was embedding chemical graph notations in PNG images. In 2007 he
wrote how to [Never Draw the Same Molecule Twice: Image Metadata for Cheminformatics](https://doi.org/10.59350/j026p-17z02).
This was picked up by several others, including me with [an implementation in JChemPaint](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2007/08/24/jchempaint-too-png-embedded.html).

Another tool that I really liked was [his Chempedia <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20101010030537/http://chempedia.com/)
which collected "[f]ree chemical information resources created and reviewed by chemists". One of the things it did
was link chemical names to chemical structures, e.g. for [this compound <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20101031093610/http://chempedia.com/substances/0-4825-8876-0064).
And because of the open license I was able to generate [an RDF representation of Chempedia](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2009/11/19/chempedia-rdf-1-sparql-end-point.html).
This resulted perhaps in one of my first online SPARQL endpoints.

One and a half year ago he was [confronted with health issues](https://doi.org/10.59350/5ct28-aaj63). Rich
blogged openly about the months after that. Rereading this post is still hard, having seen cancer in action
on my mother. It turned out to be cancer, [a brain tumor](https://doi.org/10.59350/g29jj-d3m35).
Just this Thursday I attended a fascinating <sup>2</sup>H NMR presentation, showing how much better
we got at recognizing tumors, but Rich' MRI was obvious. He blogged for months on
[his plan](https://depth-first.com/articles/2023/05/18/everyone-has-a-plan/). Until [the end of May](https://doi.org/10.59350/6beed-gk067)
this year.

Some weeks ago I received confirmation our fear; he passed away. Richard L. Apodaca was
[born in 1968](https://search.lib.utexas.edu/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991024143089706011&context=L&vid=01UTAU_INST:SEARCH&lang=en&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,39207173&sortby=rank),
completed his PhD at the University of Texas at Austin in 1996 on *Studies in enantioselective catalysis:
(1) a new class of chiral Câ‚‚-symmetric bisphenols; (2) Diorganotin dihalides* (wikidata:[Q131405461](https://scholia.toolforge.org/work/Q131405461)).
Rich published multiple papers in the field of medicinal chemistry (see [his Scholia profile](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q43837652)),
was very active in open science and [held many patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Richard+Apodaca).
His latest work was about *Balsa: A Compact Line Notation Based on SMILES*
(see doi:[10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-01ltp](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-01ltp)).

The [Depth-First blog](https://depth-first.com/) has a CC-BY 2.0 license and perhaps [Rogue Scholar](https://rogue-scholar.org/)
can archive it? It helps us remember Rich and his contributions to open science cheminformatics.
