With a year of preparation and two years of thinking, on September 1st 2024 the
Department of Bioinformatics, aka BiGCaT, merged with two other departments to
form the [Department of Translational Genomics](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/translational-genomics)
(see also [this LinkedIn announcement](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7289584128176336896?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)).
This merger creates many new opportunities while it strenghtens our bioinformatics
research. In fact, I will have more room to focus on the chemical roles in our
*more accurate understanding of biological processes*. I am looking forward to
the upcoming years!
