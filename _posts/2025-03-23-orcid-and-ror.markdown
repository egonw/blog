While this was not the primary hack project during the [ELIXIR BioHackathon Europe](https://biohackathon-europe.org/)
last autumn, but I really like BioHackrXiv and I got the question if I could have a look at getting
the ORCID logo in generated PDF. The ORCID was already in the YAML metadata of report markdown,
so it sounded easy. Well, it was a big more complicated, but all the nicer to now have the project
report online (doi:[10.37044/osf.io/p9u42_v1](https://doi.org/10.37044/osf.io/p9u42_v1)). And once the ORCID was working,
adding the [Research Organisation Registry](https://ror.org/) ID was not much harder. Cool to see both used
in other [recent BioHackrXiv reports](https://osf.io/preprints/biohackrxiv/discover?sort=-dateCreated)!
