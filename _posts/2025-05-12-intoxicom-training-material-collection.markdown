INTOXICOM is an ELIXIR Toxicoloy Community (doi:[10.12688/f1000research.74502.2](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.74502.2))
implementation study, organizing five workshops, each
one with a different topic. The first three workshops were in Utrecht
(doi:[10.37044/osf.io/un2rw](https://doi.org/10.37044/osf.io/un2rw)), Basel, and Uppsala.
The [fourth workshop](https://www.aanmelder.nl/intoxicom-ws-2/wiki/1152037/wp-4-features-ws-4)
has the theme *training material* and will be held in Birmingham (thanks
[Iseult](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iseult-lynch-b5856910/)!). And one aspect of that is to make
existing training material from toxicology projects indexed and therefore more FAIR.

Last week we had a telcon, and I promised to make an overview of some open educational resources
that I have (co-)developed over the years. It started during the eNanoMapper project, where
our Project Technical Adviser was Dr. [Cedric Notredame](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1461-0988).
He commented on us using Word documents for training materials, and that was for me a cue to
[start using](https://github.com/enanomapper/tutorials/commit/5ca03a94a3bd3b60dbb6e080f05cb9faca7eaf69)
GitHub Pages instead. We later reused this for NanoCommons, and by then GitHub Pages had
become common and the foundation for other online material for toxicology projects.

Here follows an overview of tutorials I contributed to. Some are already registered
with TeSS, but I am sure I will learn a lot of new tricks, and particularly about the
learning paths.

Hope to see you there! Register [here](https://www.aanmelder.nl/intoxicom-ws-2/wiki/1152037/wp-4-features-ws-4).
