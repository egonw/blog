This week the 13th [International Conference on Chemical Structures](https://iccs-nl.org/) took place
(see also [this Scholia overview](https://scholia.toolforge.org/event/Q133457282) or
[this overview of the full ICCS history](https://scholia.toolforge.org/event-series/Q47501052)). This
is the conference I first [joined 20 years ago](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2005/11/02/open-source-data-mining-in.html)
as a PhD student [presenting a poster](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2011/06/25/from-archives-my-iccs-2005-poster.html)
(see [these past blog posts](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/tag/iccs)).
Of course, I am actually co-organizer nowadays (actually, co-treasurer). Organizing a meeting with just over
200 participants, and I like to thank
[Gerard](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q30086276) and [Willem](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q52125630)
in particular, but also [Pieter](https://scholia.toolforge.org/Q134716139),
[Marcus](https://scholia.toolforge.org/Q47501420), [Frank](https://scholia.toolforge.org/Q47509033),
[Jenke](https://scholia.toolforge.org/Q134721967), and Frans Koeman who has helped us during the
past three events.

The meeting started, as usual, wth the [CSA Trust Mike Lynch Award](https://scholia.toolforge.org/award/Q47508692),
this year awarded to Prof. [Val Gillet](https://scholia.toolforge.org/Q42717125)
(see also [this press release](https://csa-trust.org/2025/05/23/mike-lynch-award-2025-val-gillet/)).

[This time](https://iccs-nl.org/general-information/scientific-program/), there where the following themes,
where the first was by far the most dominant theme:

* Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and QSAR (five sessions)
* New Modalities and Large Chemical Data Sets (one session)
* Advanced Cheminformatics Techniques (two sessions)
* Integrative Structure-Based Drug Design (two sessions)

My contribution this time was a poster for the [VHP4Safety](https://vhp4safety.nl/) project,
but more about that later.

Like last time, I have been annotating speakers with identifier and accounts, if they provided those:

As you can see, it also includes PDFs, for both [talks](https://iccs-nl.org/general-information/scientific-program/) and
[posters](https://iccs-nl.org/posters/). At the time of writing,
I collected PDFs of two presentations and five posters. Additions are still most welcome,
ideally with DOI, so that they can be cited (doi:[10.5281/zenodo.15494630](https://doi.org/),
doi:[10.13140/RG.2.2.27441.90720](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.27441.90720)
doi:[10.5281/zenodo.15614295](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15614295), and
doi:[10.13140/RG.2.2.36774.23365](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36774.23365))!

Finally, I like to remind everyone that there is again a
[proceedings collection in the Journal of Cheminformatics](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/ICCS25),
and presenters of oral and poster presentations are invited to submit their presented
work to this collection.
