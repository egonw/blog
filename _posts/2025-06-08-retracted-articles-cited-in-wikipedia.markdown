Last week, the [Wikidata and Sister Projects](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Event:Wikidata_and_Sister_Projects) event tooks place.
The presentations are recorded, and I strongly encourage you to check the schedule. One presentation I liked (there are more),
was the one by [Mike Peel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Mike_Peel) with the title
*"Best practices for reusing Wikidataâ€™s data in the Wikimedia Projects"*. At some point he walks us through the
[{{Cite Q}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Cite_Q) template, [around 26:07](https://www.youtube.com/live/xanSjW30g2o?feature=shared&t=1561).

I learned that this template will highlight when an article cited in Wikipedia is actually retracted (withdrawn or replaced).
Now, for the past months, I have been using the Crossref API to the [Retraction Watch Database](http://retractiondatabase.org)
and annotated thousands of articles as retracted, using URLs from the database as reference. I use
[this script](https://github.com/egonw/ons-wikidata/blob/main/RetractionWatch/quickstatements.groovy).

So, that means that this work actually has had a massive impact. Perhaps thousands of (English) Wikipedia
readers have seen the results from running that script. That is pretty awesome! This is why we do open science.

But it made me also wonder something else. The Retraction Watch Database has over 60 thousand articles and
Wikidata only about 22 thousand (at the time of writing). What if Wikipedia has an article not in Wikidata?
Well, obviously, it cannot use `{{Cite Q}}`. But wouldn't we want to have that article in Wikidata? Clearly,
the article is notable; at least, in Wikipedia notability-sense. So, I was wondering, of those 40 thousand
retracted articles not in Wikidata, how many are cited in English Wikipedia (to start with).

So, I wrote [a first script](https://github.com/egonw/ons-wikidata/blob/main/RetractionWatch/listRetractionsNotInWikidata.groovy)
that lists DOIs in the Retraction Watch Database (via the CrossRef API downloaded list) that are not found
in Wikidata. [A second script](https://github.com/egonw/ons-wikidata/blob/main/RetractionWatch/searchMissingInWikipedia.groovy)
uses a Scholia (doi:[10.1007/978-3-319-70407-4_36](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70407-4_36)) SPARQL query develop by Finn Nielsen that
[uses wikibase:mwapi to do an efficient DOI search](https://github.com/WDscholia/scholia/commit/caf2694a4).

The results are fascinating and this is the list of DOIs found:
