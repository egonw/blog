[Mike Taylor](https://sauropods.win/@mike) wrote up [a post](https://doi.org/10.59350/svpow.24000) about the various things a journal article is doing,
the first being *a scientific report*. We put a lot of money in establishing a scientific track record. In the past 30 years
how we publish our research and how we archive it has changed significantly. If you read my blog more often, you know I have
been critical of the performance of many publishers. Springer Nature was so disappointing that after 5 years I
[stepped down](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2021/06/11/conflict-of-interest-or-why-i-am.html)
as Editor-in-Chief (of two) of the [Journal of Cheminformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Cheminformatics).
There is so much that must be [done better](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2024/09/16/publishing.html).

But in the most recent iteration, triggered by some work for [WikiPathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/), I was using
[Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/) to find articles that
mention *WikiPathways* and then search in the full text for the string `WP`, as a trigger for the possible mention of
WikiPathways pathway identifiers, which look like `WP4846`. The use of *compact (resource) identifiers*
(see doi:[10.1038/sdata.2018.29](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.29)) is minimal, but at least some articles use identifiers.

That allows me to extend our WikiPathways knowledge graph of [articles citing specific pathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/browse/citedin).
At the time of writing, we collected 2509 citations from 440 different articles to 883 different pathways. Now,
I want to blog about that more, but it's related to an observation.

## Information loss
Now, back in the late ninities I learned about GNU/Linux and after playing with Red Hat and Suse, I settled for Debian.
One of the things I learned is that, generally, information corruption (like data loss) is an absolute red flag, a no-go,
a total showstopper.

And then we have this in publishing, the one area where data corruption must also be a no-go:

![](/assets/images/imageResolutionLoss.png)

In this image, the left side shows a screenshot of the publisher version of the article and on the right side
the version in [Pubmed Central](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) (PMC). PMC has been an important project to archive full text versions of articles:

> 11.2 million articles are archived in PMC.

So, this is **really bad**! The archived version is not really useful. As a human I already struggle to read the
degraded image, let alone an algorithm.

Does that matter? Yes, projects like the awesome
[Pathway Figure OCR](https://pfocr.wikipathways.org/) (see doi:[10.1186/s13059-020-02181-2](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02181-2))
depend on images to be FAIR enough to extract information. (Side note: yes, these images should be vector
graphics, but commercial publishers decided about twenty years ago that they could not care enough.)

At this moment, I do not know where the information is lost. Maybe PubMed Central is storing the images in a low
resolution. Maybe the publisher provides PMC with a low resolution image. But to me, this must be solved as soon
as possible. This is utterly unacceptable.

I wonder what the authors of the article (doi:[10.1186/s13287-025-04166-z](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-025-04166-z))
I took as example think of this.
