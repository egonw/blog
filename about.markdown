This blog deals with chemblaics in the broader sense. Chemblaics (pronounced chem-bla-ics) is the science
that uses computers to solve problems in chemistry, biochemistry and related fields. The big difference
between chemblaics and areas such as chem(o)?informatics, chemometrics, computational chemistry, etc, is that
chemblaics only uses open source software, open data, and open standards, making experimental results
reproducible and validatable. And this is a big difference!

The layout is based on the default minimal gem, version 2.5.1, but tweaked after that.
